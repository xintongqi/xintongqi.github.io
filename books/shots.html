            what exactly is zen? <br>
            rock gardens = an air of solitude = zen is nothing more than a stereotype <br>
            <br>
            ...but the Japanese people did not encourage him to leap right away into the world of zen. instead, they named several of the "Japanese art associated with zen" and suggested that he study one of those as an introduction to zen. <br>
            ikebana (flower arranging), sumie (ink painting), kyūdō <br>
            <br>
            Herrigel learning kyūdō: <br>
            draw the bow spiritually <br>
            he felt that he was not breathing but that he was being breathed <i>I laughed at this line. sorry about that...</i> <br>
            the right art is purposeless, aimless. the more obstinately you try to learn how to shoot the arrow for the sake of hitting the goal, the less you will succeed in the one and the further the other will recede. <br>
            "it shoots" <br>
