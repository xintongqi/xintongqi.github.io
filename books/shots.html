        <h2>What I Learned from the Chapters</h2>
        <p>
            Copies of Ryōanji all over the US: Chase Manhattan Bank, Japanese Embassy in DC, etc. <br>
            what exactly is zen? <br>
            rock gardens = an air of solitude = zen is nothing more than a stereotype <br>
            <br>
            ...but the Japanese people did not encourage him to leap right away into the world of zen. instead, they named several of the "Japanese art associated with zen" and suggested that he study one of those as an introduction to zen. <br>
            ikebana (flower arranging), sumie (ink painting), kyūdō <br>
            <br>
            Herrigel learning kyūdō: <br>
            draw the bow spiritually <br>
            he felt that he was not breathing but that he was being breathed <i>I laughed at this line. sorry about that...</i> <br>
            the right art is purposeless, aimless. the more obstinately you try to learn how to shoot the arrow for the sake of hitting the goal, the less you will succeed in the one and the further the other will recede. <br>
            "it shoots": "it" refers to something that transcends the self<br>
            <br>
            it was only after WWII that kyūdō became strongly associated with zen <br>
            prior to that, most people practiced kyūdō for physical training or as a pastime <br>
            even today it is very unusual for a person in Japan to practice kyūdō as a form of zen training<br>
            <br>
            the Ryōanji rock garden <br>
            what did people in the Edo period think about the rock garden? <br>
            "it is called the garden of the Tiger Cubs Crossing the River" because of the placement of the rocks<br>
            Ryōanji was just a deserted temple rarely visited by anyone until 1950.
            it did not even have a permanent chief priest.<br>
            Ryōanji became popular during the tenure of Matsukura, who was the chief priest. <br>

        <h2>Overall Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            I have to say, this book is pretty boring. I had expected to learn more about Japanese architecture, Zen and Buddhism from the book,
            but the book somehow managed to spend several chapters judging another book that I've never heard of, and probably won't ever take a look based on what I already know about it. <br>
            Honestly, I'm just not interested to learn how misinterpretation between Japanese and German could lead to misunderstanding. I can totally find another book on linguistics if I really want to learn. <br>
            Plus, it is already well-known how the west could misinterpret eastern cultures and invent "genuine Chinese food" like Panda Express. <i>Don't get me wrong. Panda Express tastes ok. I have Chinese friends who actually like Panda Express. But it simply is not Chinese food at all.</i><br>
            The biggest problem about this book is that much portion of this book is composed of the author's own perspectives, rather than facts. And, the author can be, quite sarcastic sometimes. <br>
            Overall, the book is boring, not because the language is dry, but because of the contents. I can't believe they make up to a hundred-page book. <br>
            Apologies to the author. <br>
