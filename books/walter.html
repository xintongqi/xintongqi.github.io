        His soul is that of Adam, to whom Eve (the world) once upon a time offered the apple, from which he ate...he bought at the price of eternal remorse. <br>
        <br>
        Baudelaire as littérateur. <br>
        <br>
        What speaks to us in his poetry is not the reprehensible confusion of [moral] judgement but the permissible reversal of perception. <br>
        <i>This is to say, B cares about how the same thing can be viewed both as good and evil, instead of how a good thing can have evil effects, and vice versa. 
            Another way to say this is B doesn’t care about moral judgement. He cares about perception. 
            More explantion in the quote below.

        ...it is the melancholic above all whose gaze is fixed on the ideal, and that it is the images of melancholy that kindle the spiritual most brightly? <br>
        <br>
        For the first time, with Baudelaire, Paris becomes the subject of lyric poetry. 
        This poetry is no hymn to the homeland; rather, the gaze of the allegorist, as it falls on the city, is the gaze of the alienated man. 
        It is the gaze of the flâneur, whose way of life still conceals behind a mitigating nimbus the coming desolation of the big-city dweller. <br>
        <br>
        He seeks refuge in the crowd. <br>
        <br>
        In the flâneur, the intelligentsia sets foot in the marketplace-ostensibly to look around, but in truth to find a buyer. <br>
        <br>
        The last poem of Les Fleurs du Mal: "Le Voyage." "Death, old admiral, up the anchor now." 
        The last journey of the flâneur: death. Its destination: the new. "Deep in the Unknown to find the new!" 
        Newness is a quality independent of the use value of the commodity. It is the origin of the semblance that belongs inalienably to images produced by the collective unconcious. 
        It is the quintessence of that false consciousness whose indefatigable agent is fashion. This semblance of the new is reflected, like one mirror in a nother, in the semblance of the ever recurrent.
        The product of this reflection is the phantasmagoria of "cultural history", in which the bourgeoisie enjoys its false consciousness to the full.

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        Walter Benjamin compared Baudelaire as a photographer who only captures the evil. 
        But Baudelaire himself has the plates, which he shows no one, that includes both the positive and the negative. <br>
