        <h2 id="unhappiness">Different Reasons of Unhappiness</h2>
        <p>
            Two factors of unhappiness: social system and individual psychology. <br>
            <br>
            External discipline is the only road to happiness for those unfortunates whose self-absorption is too profound to be cured in any other way. <br>
            There are three kinds of self-absorption <br>
            - sinner: constantly feel sinned, and feel that what they do disgrade themselves, and thus do nothing. <br>
            - narcissist: wish to be admired. <br>
            - megalomaniac: admire power, largely due to the fact that they were once humuliated. <br>
            The latter two types believe that happiness does exist. <br>
            <br>
            All serious success in work depends on some genuine interest in the material with which the work is concerned. <br>
            <br>
            A typical unhappy man: <br>
            => deprived in youth of some normal satisfaction <br>
            => value it more than everything <br>
            => live a "one-sided direction" life + undue emphasis upon the achievement as opposed to the activities connected with it <br>
            <br>
            seeks no form of satisfaction but only distraction and oblivion will only make life bearable by becoming less alive <br>
            <br>
            
            <b>Byronic Unhappiness</b><br>
            I have frequently experienced myself the mood in which I felt that all is vanity; I have emerged from it not by means of any philosophy. but owing to some imperative necessity of action. <br>
            <br>
            the mere absence of effort from his life removes an essential ingredient of happiness <br>
            <br>
            The habit of looking to the future and thinking that the whole meaning of the present lies in what it will bring forth is a pernicious one. 
            Life is not to be conceived on the analogy of a melodrama in which the hero and heroine go through incredible misfortunes for which they are compensated by a happy ending. <br>
            <br>
            give yourself an existence in which the satisfaction of elementary physical needs will occupy all your energies. <br>
            <br>

            <b>Competition</b><br>
            What people fear when they engage in the struggle is not that they will not that they will fail to get their breakfast next morning, but that they will fail to outshine their neighbors. <br>
            <br>
            So long as he not only desires success, but is whole heartedly persuaded that it is a man's duty to pursue success and that a man who does not do so is a poor creature, so long his life will remain too concentrated and too anxious to be happy. <br>
            <br>
            The social scale in America is indefinite and continually fluctuating. Consequently all the snobbish emotions become more restless than they are where the social order is fixed...Therefore, when the market is in ticklish condition, a man feels the way young people feel during an examination. <br>
            <br>
            success is the only one ingredient in happiness, and is too dearly purchased if all the other ingredients have been sacrificed to obtain it. <br>
            <br>
            It's therefore easier to judge of their merit by the income to be inferred from their standard of life. <br>
            <br>
            Unless a man has been taught what to do with success after getting it, the achievement of it must inevitably leave him a prey to boredom. <br>
            <br>
            the prodigious success of these modern dinosaurs, who, like their prehistoric prototypes, prefer power to intelligence, is causing them to be universally imitated. <br>
            <br>

            <b>Boredom and Excitement</b><br>
            The desire for excitement is very deep-stated in human beings, especially in males. <br>
            <br>
            We are less bored than our ancestors were, but we are more afraid of boredom...As we rise in the social scale the pursuit of excitement becomes more and more intense...
            After all the mornings are boring in proportion as the previous evenings were amusing. <br>
            <br>
            A certain power of enduring boredom is therefore essential to a happy life...All great books contain boring portions, and all great lives have contained uninteresting stretches. <br>
            <br>
            No great achievement is possible without persistent work, so absorbing and so difficult that little energy is left over for the more strenous kinds of amusement. <br>
            <br>
            the most primitive possible form is union with the life of Earth. But in a higher for the same thing is to be found in poetry. <br>
            <br>

            <b>Fatigue</b><br>
            sources of nervousness and tension: noise, investigate strangers, shuttles <br>
            <br>
            To a great extent fatigue in such cases is due to worry, and worry could be prevented by a better philosophy of life and a little more mental discipline <br>
            <br>
            not in a way to produce a sound life of conduct on the morrow, but in that half-insane way that characterizes the troubled meditations ofo insomnia. <br>
            <br>
            The wise man thinks about his troubles only when there is some purpose in doing so; at other times he thinks about other things, or, if it is right, about nothing at all. <br>
            <br>
            disciplined mind: <br>
            => think about a matter adequately at the right time rather than inadequately at all times <br>
            => when a difficult or worrying decision has to be reached, as soon as all the data are available, give the matter your best thought and make your decision; having made the decision, do not revise it unless some new fact comes to your knowledge. <br>
            <br>
            A great many worries can be diminished by realizing the unimportance of the matter which is causing the anxiety. <br>
            <br>
            whether I spoke well or ill, the universe would remain much the same in either case. <br>
            <br>
            Our doings are not so important as we naturally suppose; our successes and failures do not after all matter very much. Even great sorrows can be survived; troubles which seem as if they must put an end to happiness for life fade with the lapse of time until it becomes almost impossible to remember their poignancy. <br>

            Every kind of fears grows worse by not being looked at. <br>
