        Note that some portions of this book are considered extremely offensive by some people. Please don't read it if you feel like you are one of them. <br>
        As for me, I just treat it as a book, and nothing more. I read books, regardless of its contents, as long as there are some good sentences in there. Or maybe just one single line that truly touches me. <br>
        Someone's dropping down something on a piece of paper to be heard, to be understood, so I read those pages. That's it. <br>

        <p>
            If I longed for destruction it was merely that this eye might be extinguished. I longed for an earthquake, for some cataclysm of nature which would plunge the lighthouse into the sea. 
            I wanted a metamorphsis, a change to fish, to leviathan, to destroyer. I wanted the earth to open up, to swallow everything in one engulfing yawn. I wanted to see teh city buried fathoms deep in the bosom of the sea.
            I wanted to sit in a cave and read by candlelight. I wanted that eye extinguished so that I might have a change to know my own body, my own desires. I wanted to be alone for a thousand years in order to reflect on what I had seen and heard - and in order to forget. I wanted something of the earth which was not of man's doing, something absolutely divorced from the human of which I was surfeited. 
            I wanted something purely terrestrial and absolutely divested of idea. I wanted to feel the blood running back into my veins, even at the cost of annihilation. I wanted to shake the stone and the light out of my system.
            I wanted the dark fecundity of nature, the deep well of the womb, silence, or else the lapping of the black waters of death. I wanted to be that night which the remorseless eye illuminated, a night diapered with stars and trailing comets.
            To be of night, so frighteningly silent, so utterly incomprehensible and eloquent at the same time. Never more to speak or to listen or to think. To be englobed and encompassed and to encompass and to englobe at the same time.
            No more pity, no more tenderness. TO be human only terrestrially, like a plant or a worm or a brook. To be decomposed, divested of light and stone, variable as the molecule, durable as the atom, heartless as the earth itself. <br>
            <i>Just beautiful</i><br>
