        <h2>Excerpts</h2>
        <p>
            Janie and I ordered plain fried eggs with bacon, but Phillip ordered two three-and-a-half-minute boiled eggs. <br>
            <i>One sentence, and you see a jerk.</i> <br>
            <br>

            “The Latin Quarter’s in Paris,” I said, “and all we have is a strip of the Normandy peninsula. I don’t think we’ll see Paris this time.” “There might be a breakthrough to Paris at any event. However, the main thing is to get out of America.” <br>
            <br>

            We had cigarettes but no matches. Phil called out to the waitress, “I say, have you a match, miss?” The waitress said, “No.” Phillip said, “Then get some,” in his clear, calm tone. <br>
            The waitress got a wooden box of matches from under the counter and threw it at him. It lit in my empty egg plate and knocked some french fries out on the counter. Phillip picked up the box and lighted all our cigarettes. Then he threw the box back so it lit on the counter near her. She jumped at the sound and said, “Oh! I shouldn’t have given them to you.” Phillip smiled at her. I said, “She must be having her period.” <br>
            <br>

            “So you want to wait. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow—waiting till you’re dead. Do you know what I think? I think this whole Phillip complex is like the Christian heaven, an illusion born of a need, floating around in some nebulous misty Platonic nowhere, always just around the corner like prosperity, but never here and now. You’re afraid to go away with him, you’re afraid to put it to a test because you know it won’t work.” <br>
            <i>Phillip complex. Haha.</i> <br>
            <br>

            Al said, “I want him to love me.” I turned around and took a toothpick out of my shirt pocket and started digging at a cavity. “You’re nuts,” I said. “I know he’ll come around to my way of thinking in time,” Al said. I pointed my toothpick at his chest. “Get yourself some scratch and he’ll come around tonight.” <br>
            <br>

            “Now listen,” I said. “I’m going to say it again and I’m going to say it slow: Phillip isn’t queer. He might sleep with you, which I doubt altogether, but anything permanent is impossible. Unless of course it’s just friendship you want.” <br>
            <i>Sad but true. It just applies to so many things. Once you start to care, things become different. </i> <br>
            <br>

            We went out to eat at Hamburger Mary’s and he started rehashing the Phillip question. What did it mean when Phillip said this and should he call him up tonight or just go downtown without calling, was Phillip really in love with Barbara and if so should he do anything to break it up. So I ate my food and said, yes, why not, no, go ahead, and stopped listening to him. Like I say, I’d heard all this for years. <br>
            <br>

            “I love you,” she said. “So do I.” “Why don’t we ever get married?” “We will some day.” “You bastard, you know you’ll never get around to it.” “Sure we will. Remember that letter I wrote you from New Orleans?” “You were just horny then,” she said. “You didn’t mean it.” “Nuts,” I said. <br>
            <br>

            That sort of technical virginity was a pain in the neck. <br>
            <i>This is my favorite line in this book. Together with the term "Phillip complex".</i><br>
            <br>

            He had a third martini. He looked at me intently and took hold of my arm. <br>
            “Look,” he said. “You’re a fish in a pond. It’s drying up. You have to mutate into an amphibian, but someone keeps hanging on to you and telling you to stay in the pond, everything’s going to be all right.” <br>
            I asked him why he didn’t take yoga in that case, and he said the sea was more to the point. The bartender had the radio going. <br>
            A news broadcaster was telling about a circus fire, and I heard him say, <b>“And the hippos were boiled to death in their tanks.”</b> <br>
            He gave these details with the unctuous relish characteristic of radio announcers. <br>
            <i>Now this is my favorite paragraph in the book. It FEELS SO SAD. so sad that I almost feel bad for Phillip, as if the entire Phillip complex wasn't all his fault, as if he deserved to be treated better by this huge pond. </i><br>
            <br>

            “Yes,” he said. “I just get as close to him as I can without waking him up, and stand there till dawn.” <br>
            <i>Seems romantic, but it really is pretty creepy...</i> <br>
            <br>

            A typical modern Puritan, she was able to believe in sin without believing in God. In fact, she felt there was something soft and sinful about believing in God. She rejected such indulgence like an indecent proposal. <br>
            <br>

            The girl behind the desk encouraged us to sign one of the petitions, which was all about a current fight in the House and Senate over a new postwar bill. Phillip and I signed them “Arthur Rimbaud” and “Paul Verlaine,” respectively. <br>
            <br>

            “It’s for five months and I’m broke, you know that. But don’t worry, we’ll get a ship together. Just leave it to me.” <br>
            <br>

            “Well,” I said, “I wouldn’t embark on anything like that unless I were drunk.” “We’ll get drunk in port and start off in the middle of the night.” <br>
            <br>

            Phillip hit a bus stop sign, which waved back and forth, so Al jumped up on a wooden shelf for newspapers that was in front of a candy store and knocked it down. The Greek rushed out of the store and grabbed Al, and Al had to give him a dollar. <br>
            <i>This is so new york.</i> <br>
            <br>

            I asked Agnes if she would join us for dinner but she said no, she was broke. I said, “On me,” and she still said no. <br>
            She was always like that. So I said good night and walked out. <br>
            The others were standing in the street in front of the house. <br>
            I said, “Agnes wouldn’t come for dinner because she is broke. Some people have some pride.” <br>
            Phillip said, “People get silly ideas.” <br>
            “Yeah,” I said, “but you’re an artist. You don’t believe in decency and honesty and gratitude. Where shall we eat?” <br>
            <br>

            I began to get a feeling familiar to me from my bartending days of being the only sane man in a nut-house. It doesn’t make you feel superior but depressed and scared, because there is nobody you can contact. Right then I decided to go home. <br>
            <i>Everyone feels this somehow. This is essentially because we are all alone in the end. But that's fine.</i> <br>
            <br>

            I had the feeling that all over America such stupid arguments were taking place on street corners and in bars and restaurants. <br> 
            All over America, people were pulling credentials out of their pockets and sticking them under someone else’s nose to prove they had been somewhere or done something. <br>
            And I thought someday everyone in America will suddenly jump up and say “I don’t take any shit!” and start pushing and cursing and clawing at the man next to him. <br>
            <br>

            As we were walking out of the joint, Phillip picked up a long reed of macaroni from the cook’s display in the window and carried it out like a cane. <br>
            When we were on the sidewalk, he put the end of the reed against his fly and it looked just like a shimmering spurt of piss. <br> 
            Men going by in the evening rush stared until they saw it was only macaroni, and they moved on without a pause. <br>
            Women turned their heads away and pretended not to notice. <br> 
            Phillip walked toward the Apollo theater holding it against his fly and looked like a guy who was taking a piss as he walked. <br>
            <i>The funny thing is not how Phillip goes banana, but how those "sane people" pretend not to see.</i> <br>
            <br>

            “You bastard!” she screamed. “You’re trying to mar my beauty!” <br>
            <i>Hahaha</i><br>
            <br>

            Phillip was sitting up on the couch. “Darling,” he said in a loud voice, “I can’t hide my love any longer.” <br>
            <br>

            When we got to Hoboken, the city was all covered over with a pall of hot gray smoke from a fire on the waterfront. Every now and then a piece of soot dropped down, like black snow in an ash-colored oven-hot sky. <br>
            <br>

            We sat at a long wood table and ordered beer, which arrived in large steins. Phillip sat opposite Barbara and he stuck his head across the table from time to time and she petted him on the hair. It was disgusting. Finally he leaned over and took her right index finger in his teeth. The nail makeup was a little loose and he peeled it off with his teeth. <br>
            <i>"It was disgusting". Hahaha</i><br>
            <br>

            I said, “Danny, would you be interested in burning down a house for two hundred dollars?” His face brightened up and he said, “That sounds pretty good.” <br>
            <i>Danny boy this is a showdown</i> <br>
            <br>

            In a play court on the right, a whole platoon of little children were seesawing and playing hopscotch and wading in a pool in the hot sun. Phillip smiled at the children. I knew he was thinking of himself as a murderer. <br>
            <i>This line is so so sooooooo freaking sad. Even for someone like Phillip, yes, even for someone like him...</i> <br>
            <br>

            Phil said, “Wherever they send me, I’ll be able to do what I would have done at sea.” <br> 
            “You know,” I said, “I knew we wouldn’t ship out, because I wasn’t dreaming about the sea.” <br>
            “I’ll write poetry,” Phillip said. <br>
            <i>These couple of lines are by themselves poetry.</i> <br>
            <br>

            It was the loneliest beer I ever had. I finally walked out and there I was, all alone, standing on Third Avenue in the late afternoon. The Elevated roared by overhead, and the big trucks rumbled by. Here I was, all alone, and everything was finished. <br>
            <i>Everything finished like a beer in your hand. How sad is that?</i> <br>
            <br>

            We shook hands and patted each other on the shoulders and leered at each other, smiling. Then he said “So long” and I said “So long” and he turned and went into the lobby, and I walked toward Columbus Circle where two big trucks went by that made me want to travel far. <br>
            <br>

            Danny thought about it for a minute and said, “Well, he can go into politics when he gets out.” “Yeah,” I said. “He ought to be good at that.” <br>
            <b>THE END</b><br>

                For anyone who just walked in, the basics: the enmeshed relationship between Lucien Carr IV and David Eames Kammerer began in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1936, when Lucien was eleven and Dave was twenty-five. Eight years, five states, four prep schools, and two colleges later, that connection was grown too intense, those emotions too feverish; as “Will Dennison” writes in Hippos, “When they get together, something happens.” Something had to give, and something finally did. <br>
            </i>

            <br>

            <i>
                But as Burroughs told Ted Morgan, “I was there in the courtroom. … I walked out with Lucien’s lawyer, who said [to me], ‘I think it would have been very bad for his character, for him to get off scot free’—so his heart wasn’t in the case at all, he didn’t want to get him off. He was kind of moralistic about it.” <br>
