        <h2>About Pointers</h2>
        <p>
            Sometimes I feel like I'm just a dangling pointer pointing nowhere. I have no human-readable value. <br> 
            If someone ever tries to dereference me and gets to know what I mean, I'll just blow up their entire program and dump their core :) <br>
            <br>
            At other times I feel like I'm a null pointer, pretending that I'm pointing to something meaningful, but in the end I'm just directed to the bottom of the random access memory, an address where no one resides. <br>
            NULL. <br>
            Which is sort of scary. The word itself. <br>
            At first sight I looked ok, but once you dereferenced me... <br>
            <br>
            There are also times that I feel like a void*. I can be anything. At least I believe that's true. <br>
            So it's a different type of void. Unlike null, which is basically null. Nothing. Void suggests unlimited possibilities. <br>
            I guess sometimes unlimited possibilities is just another way of saying nothing. <br>
            Because in the end if you don't land on something, you still can't be dereferenced. You have a value that you simply cannot tell. <br> 
            <br>
            Pointers are quite interesting, right? Almost philosophical... <br>
            I don't know why I have all these random weird thoughts. Probably because I'm too sucked into Advanced Programming hahaha. <br>
            The magical world of C, Linux and endless...pointers! <br>

        <h2>About Debugging</h2>
        <p>
            Bugs can be frustrating. <br>
            <br>
            Recently I received some of the best advice I could possibly get from some brilliant people. <br>
            <br>
            Someone told me: if there is a bug, that means there's something you did wrong as a human, because the way a program executes is well-defined. <br>
            <br>
            So what you can do is to debug your program and ask yourself: <br>
            - What is it that you want to achieve? <br>
            - What is the expected outcome of your program? <br>
            - What is it actually producing? <br>
