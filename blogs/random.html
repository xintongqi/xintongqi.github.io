    <div id="pointers">
        <h2>About Pointers</h2>
        <p>
            Sometimes I feel like I'm just a dangling pointer pointing nowhere. I have no human-readable value. <br> 
            If someone ever tries to dereference me and gets to know what I mean, I'll just blow up their entire program and dump their core :) <br>
            <br>
            At other times I feel like I'm a null pointer, pretending that I'm pointing to something meaningful, but in the end I'm just directed to the bottom of the random access memory, an address where no one resides. <br>
            NULL. <br>
            Which is sort of scary. The word itself. <br>
            At first sight I looked ok, but once you dereferenced me... <br>
            <br>
            There are also times that I feel like a void*. I can be anything. At least I believe that's true. <br>
            So it's a different type of void. Unlike null, which is basically null. Nothing. Void suggests unlimited possibilities. <br>
            I guess sometimes unlimited possibilities is just another way of saying nothing. <br>
            Because in the end if you don't land on something, you still can't be dereferenced. You have a value that you simply cannot tell. <br> 
            <br>
            Pointers are quite interesting, right? Almost philosophical... <br>
            I don't know why I have all these random weird thoughts. Probably because I'm too sucked into Advanced Programming hahaha. <br>
            The magical world of C, Linux and endless...pointers! <br>

    <div id="debug">
        <h2>About Debugging</h2>
        <p>
            Bugs can be frustrating. <br>
            <br>
            Recently I received some of the best advice I could possibly get from some brilliant people. <br>
            <br>
            Someone told me: if there is a bug, that means there's something you did wrong as a human, because the way a program executes is well-defined. <br>
            <br>
            So what you can do is to debug your program and ask yourself: <br>
            - What is it that you want to achieve? <br>
            - What is the expected outcome of your program? <br>
            - What is it actually producing? <br>
        </p>

    <div id="columbia">
        <h2>Some Columbia Stuff</h2>
        <p>
            The chairs in literally all Columbia libraries are EXTREMELY anti-human and uncomfortable. <br>
            I always feel like I've broken my back, my neck and of course, caused some serious irreversible damage to my brain, after sitting there and studying for as little as half an hour. <br>
            <br>
            
            Overnight oats at John Jay is ok if you like cinnamon and coconut. <br> 
            I tried to copy the recipe, but it didn't really taste the same. The recipe I used was: instant oat + skim milk + honey + cinnamon + yogurt + banana. <br>
            Yea I guess it's probably because I didn't use coconut milk. <br>
            <br>

            Can we have a Vampire Weekend concert at Columbia? It'll be awesome!!! <br>

    <div id="visit">
        <h2>Places That I Wanna Visit</h2>
        In fact, I have visited some of these places already. Even multiple times...
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Paris, France</b><br>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montparnasse_Cemetery">Montparnasse Cemetery</a>. Just to visit a random person buried here every couple of years, if I can, for his works taught me the essence of poetry in this big big world, and the meaning of true beauty. <br>
                <a href="https://www.pierreherme.com/">Pierre Herme</a>.  They have the best Macarons in the world!! <br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Italy, better be Rome</b> <br>
                Because I learn Italian myself, and I wonder if anyone other than Duolingo can understand what I say. <br>
                And because presumably I wouldn't be able to understand any of the accents from other parts of Italy. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Nara, Japan</b><br>
                Been to Japan once. Tokyo mostly. I personally like those densely populated cities because everything is so accessible and you can literally "disappear" in the crowd. 
                But from time to time I seek another kind of disappearance, the kind of disappearance where I'm extinct to the outside world, where no one can find me and pull me back.
                Why Nara? No idea. Just feel like it might be a good choice. This is called instinct hahaha.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>US</b><br>
                Columbia. For nostalgic reasons. <br>
                <a href="https://www.yellowstone.org/">Yellowstone</a>. Watched a ton of documentaries about this place, but never been there. It looks breathtaking in the lens. <br>
