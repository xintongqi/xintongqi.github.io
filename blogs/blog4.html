            I am living at the Villa Borghese. There is not a crumb of dirt anywhere, nor a chair misplaced. We are all alone here and we are dead. <br>
            <i>The very opening of the entire book. Cannot be nicer.</i><br>
            <br>
            The cancer of time is eating us away. <br>
            <br>
            I have no money, no resources, no hopes. I am the happiest man alive. A year ago, six months ago, I thought that I was an artist. I no longer think about it. I am. Everything that was literature has fallen from me. There are no more books to be written. Thank God. 
            This then? This is not a book. This is libel, slander, defamation of character. This is not a book, in the ordinary sense of the word. No, this is a prolonged insult, a gob of spit in the face of Art, 
            a kick in the pants to God, Man, Destiny, Time, Love, Beauty...what you will. I am going to sing for you, a little off key perhaps, but I will sing. I will sing while you croak, I will dance over your dirty corpse.<br>
            <br>
            The world around me is dissolving, leaving here and there spots of time. <br>
            <br>
            Yes, he knows how to build a fire, but I know how to inflame a cunt. <br>
