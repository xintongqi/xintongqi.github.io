    <p><b>First (fragmentary) encounter: Eastern Han Dynasty via trade routes, Mahayana</b><br>
        Confucianism (disrepute), Buddhism (elite, practices similar to Taoism)<br>
        Obstacles: scarcity of authoritative Buddhist masters, lack of accurate translations of Indian texts <br>
        Kumarajiva <br>
        Evolution: Northern and Southern Dynasties <br>
        Golden Age: Sui and Tang (silk road, Hsuan-tsang and I-ching traveled to India, support of the court) <br>
        An Lu-shan rebellion: marks the beginning of the end of large-scale state patronage of Buddhism <br>
        Hui-chang persecution: Buddhism went into a long and inexorable decline <br>
        <br>

        <b>Four periods:</b> <br>
        preparation (Eastern Han and early Six Dynasties) <br>
        demestication (N & S Dynasties) <br>
        independent growth (Sui & Tang) <br>
        appropriation (Five Dynasties ++) <br>

        <b>How "authentic" is Chinese Buddhism? => the Buddhist conquest of China || the Chinese transformation of Buddhism?</b><br>
        "missionaries" might have been religious refugees <br>
        little evidence that Indian or even central Asian Buddhist priests were active in large numbers <br>
        Kumarajiva's translation might be problematic <br>
        approch Buddhism through Taoism: replete with Taoist cosmology, terminology and meesianic eschatology <br>
        ... <br>
        But what is authentic? what is right? Who would have been in the position to judge?<br>
        There is no normative Buddhism. <br>
        <i>To claim privileged access to original or pure Buddhism, whether on the basis of the lineage, knowledge of scripture, meditative discipline, inner purity, or personal insight, 
            is to claim the authority and prestige of the tradition as one's own.
        </i> <br>
        <br>

        <b>Reconsider Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism and "syncretism"</b><br>
        The problem with syncretism: the category of syncretism presupposes the existence of distinct religious entities 
        that predate the syncretic amalgan precisely what is absent, or at least un recoverable. in the case of Buddhism. <br>
        <i>The authority of the word "Buddhism" lies not in its normative significations so much as in its rhetorical deployments. 
            This indeterminacy forced local Buddhist ecclesiastics to circumscribe orthodoxy and othorpraxis by juxtaposing Buddhism with the heterodox teachings of their imeediate rivals: 
            All self-conscious religious traditions define themselves through contradistinctions with the beliefs and practices of their neighbors.</i> <br>
        The unity of the three creeds (san-chiao ho-i) <br>
        misleading to conceive of the signification of Buddhism in terms of a dialogue between two discrete cultural traditions: <br>
        - dialogue is one sided <br>
        - Buddhism is construed in terms that compromise its descriptive value and analytic leverage <br>

        <br>
        The problem with cross-cultural transmission and translation: the Chinese preferred to translate foreign terms and concepts, creating sinitic neologisms when necessary <br>
        The nature of Chinese orthography: one cannot read the Chinese script aloud without actually knowing the language <br>

    <p>
        <p>Sharf argues that there is no "normative" Buddhism, which is why he is skeptical about the frame that denies Chinese Buddhism. However, I agree with the view that the Chinese never truly understood Indian Buddhism. Instead, they developed their own interpretation based on Chinese cultural traditions. I think the reason why these religious traditions come together so well is largely due to the fact that the "Chinese" version of Buddhism shares lots of similarities with local religions such as Taoism. In fact, Chinese Buddhism is more like a local religion developed upon the skeleton of Indian Buddhism. For example, Buddhism and Taoism share extremely similar ideas on renunciation. As for conflicts, few can be found among the three creeds due to syncretism. This is not only because there were inaccurate translations, but also because in order to survive on this land, Indian Buddhism had to embrace sinification. For example, the Chinese Buddhists twisted their narratives on leaving their families to tailor to the Confucian view of filial piety. This syncretism is more obvious among the masses who are less educated to interpret the original Indian Buddhist scripts, which is why we need to look closer at popular practices. It suggests that the lay/pro divide in China exists largely due to the knowledge gap between the masses and the elites, as the masses do not have access to the more accurately translated written scripts as the elites do.
