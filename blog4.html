    <h1>INDIA</h1>
    <h1>CHINA</h1>

    <h2>Transmission: Early Problems, Dharma King, Ghost Festival</h2>
    <h3>Wright, 21-64</h3>
    <p>First encounter: Eastern Han Dynasty via trade routes, Mahayana<br>
    Confucianism (disrepute), Buddhism (elite, practices similar to Taoism)<br>
    Obstacles: scarcity of authoritative Buddhist masters, lack of accurate translations of Indian texts <br>
    Kumarajiva <br>
    Evolution: Northern and Southern Dynasties <br>
    Golden Age: Sui and Tang (silk road, Hsuan-tsang and I-ching traveled to India, support of the court) <br>
    An Lu-shan rebellion: marks the beginning of the end of large-scale state patronage of Buddhism <br>
    Hui-chang persecution: Buddhism went into a long and inexorable decline <br>
    <br><br>
    Four periods: <br>
    preparation (Eastern Han and early Six Dynasties) <br>
    demestication (N & S Dynasties) <br>
    independent growth (Sui & Tang) <br>
    appropriation (Five Dynasties ++) <br>
    <br><br>
    How "authentic" is Chinese Buddhism? --> the Buddhist conquest of China || the Chinese transformation of Buddhism?<br>
    "missionaries" might have been religious refugees <br>
    Kumarajiva's translation might be problematic <br>
    approch Buddhism through Taoism: replete with Taoist cosmology, terminology and meesianic eschatology <br>
    ... <br>
    <br><br>
    Reconsider Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism <br>
