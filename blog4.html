    <p><b>The Period of Preparation</b><br>
        preconditions of the spread of the influence of Buddhism in China: <br>
        make the Chinese of all classes responsive to new ideas and institutions, particularly those of alien origin <br>
        make Buddhism go through the preliminary process of adaptation <br>
        <br>

        <b>Humanizing of Confucianism</b><br>
        struggle among the four groups (the entrenched great families, the eunuchs, the nouveaux riches and the intelligntsia) => conflicting power interests => naturalistic critique of Han Confucianism <br>
        reluctant to renounce all the principles of order, hierarchy and stability which that synthesis had provided <br>
        turned to the long-neglected classics of Taoism => no positive means of restoring a viable society (pure escapism, cynical peace with the corrupt tyrants...)<br>
        <i>Yet it was the cataclysm of mass revolt and political collapse which inspired further and more searching attacks on the old orthodoxy, bringing it at last into something like total disrepute</i><br>
        The breakdown of the ecumenical order of the Han permitted the spread of Buddhism throughout the Chinese world <br>
        <br>

        <b>Spread of Buddhism</b><br>
        Buddhism spread from the Indo-Iranian and Serindian kingdoms of Central Asia along the routes of trade <br>
        In China, the religion moved along the main routes of internal trade and communication <br>
        Tun-huang figures early as a Buddhist center <br>
        <br>

        <b>Divergence: China and India</b><br>
        languages: uninflected, logographic, largely monosyllabic, no systematized grammar <i>vs</i> highly inflected, alphabetic, polysyllabic, highly elaborated grammartical system <br>
        literary modes: terseness, metaphors from familiar nature, concrete image <i>vs</i> discursive, hyperbolic in its metaphors, full of abstractions <br>
        attitudes toward the individual: little disposition to analyze the personality into its components <i>vs</i> highly developed science of psychological analysis <br>
        concepts of time and space: think of both as finite and reckon time in life-spans, generations or political eras <i>vs</i> think of both as infinite and think of cosmic eons rather than units of terrestrial life <br>
        *** social and political values: familism and particularistic ethics <i>vs</i> salvation outside the family <br>
                                         concentrated efforts on formulars for the good society <i>vs</i> laid particular stress upon the pursuit of other-worldly goals <br>
        <br>

        <b>Translation</b><br>
        First Mahayana translation accessible and reasonably intelligible: done by Dharmaraksa in 286 <br>
        Confucian and Taoist terms were used to render Buddhist terms. "offensive" words are eliminated <br>
        *** ko-i: matching concepts => choosing a group of Buddhist ideas and matchig them with a plausibly analogous grouping of indigenous ideas <br>
        apologetic writing: defense of the alien system. indicates the greatest conflicts between the two traditions <br>
        <br>

        <b>Early Buddhism and Taoism</b><br>
        Early Buddhism is generally regarded as a sect of religious Taoism. <br>
        <br>

        <i>I do not believe that there is anything in the world more propoer to dispose the spirit and the heart of the Chinese to embrace our holy religion than to make them see how it is in conformaty with their ancient and legitimate philosophy. </i>
        <br><br>

        <b>Typical Chinese Literati Who Turned to Buddhist</b><br>
        early training in Confucian classics <br>
        developed a strong interest in Lao-tzu and Chuang-tzu and achieved mastery in these texts <br>
        one day heard a famous monk lecture <br>
        became a monk, studied and began to preach <br>
        <br>
        
        <b>Mahayana and Hinayana: Subitism (tun) and Gradualism (chien)</b><br>
        Mahayana: after salvation the help of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas and the possibility of a single and sudden moment of enlightenment 
        => Subitism: apprehension of reality in a sudden and complete vision (associated with Taoism)<br>
        Hinayana: prescribe an age-long and arduous accumulation of positive karma leading to ultimate release into nirvana 
        = > Gradualism: approach to the ultimate reality by analysis, the accumulation of long study (associated with Confucianism)<br>
        <br>

        <b>Emperor Wu of the Liang</b><br>
        ordered to forsake Taoism and embrace Buddhism <br>
        <br>

        <b>Vimalakirti for the Rich and Powerful</b><br>
        Vimalakirti was not a naked ascetic but a rich and powerful aristocrat <br>
        new satisfaction for the rich and powerful in the lavish building of temples and retreats in the developing style of Chinese Buddhist architecture <br>
        <br>

        <b>North and South</b><br>
        in the South: Buddhism adjusted to elite and popular culture, interacted with southern philosophical and literary traditions, developed its beliefs and practices in response to the society <br>
        in the North: endless wars. Buddhism was introduced with its superior magical power. Buddhism did not have competition of an entrenched religious Taoism, and the peasantry were converted en masse. <br>
        Buddhist monks from the north migrated to the south and southern monks went north. <br>
        <br>
        
        <b>Kumarajiva</b>
        Mahayana Buddhism was presented in Chinese with far greater clarity and precision than ever before <br>
        Sunyata - Nagarjuna's concept of the void - was disentangled from the Taoist terminology <br>
        <br>
    </p>

    <h3>Sharf, 4-25</h3>

    <p><b>First (fragmentary) encounter: Eastern Han Dynasty via trade routes, Mahayana</b><br>
        Confucianism (disrepute), Buddhism (elite, practices similar to Taoism)<br>
        Obstacles: scarcity of authoritative Buddhist masters, lack of accurate translations of Indian texts <br>
        Kumarajiva <br>
        Evolution: Northern and Southern Dynasties <br>
        Golden Age: Sui and Tang (silk road, Hsuan-tsang and I-ching traveled to India, support of the court) <br>
        An Lu-shan rebellion: marks the beginning of the end of large-scale state patronage of Buddhism <br>
        Hui-chang persecution: Buddhism went into a long and inexorable decline <br>
        <br>

        <b>Four periods:</b> <br>
        preparation (Eastern Han and early Six Dynasties) <br>
        demestication (N & S Dynasties) <br>
        independent growth (Sui & Tang) <br>
        appropriation (Five Dynasties ++) <br>
        <br>

        <b>How "authentic" is Chinese Buddhism? => the Buddhist conquest of China || the Chinese transformation of Buddhism?</b><br>
        "missionaries" might have been religious refugees <br>
        little evidence that Indian or even central Asian Buddhist priests were active in large numbers <br>
        Kumarajiva's translation might be problematic <br>
        approch Buddhism through Taoism: replete with Taoist cosmology, terminology and meesianic eschatology <br>
        ... <br>
        But what is authentic? what is right? Who would have been in the position to judge?<br>
        There is no normative Buddhism. <br>
        <i>To claim privileged access to original or pure Buddhism, whether on the basis of the lineage, knowledge of scripture, meditative discipline, inner purity, or personal insight, 
            is to claim the authority and prestige of the tradition as one's own.
        </i> <br>
        <br>

        <b>Reconsider Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism and "syncretism"</b><br>
        The problem with syncretism: the category of syncretism presupposes the existence of distinct religious entities 
        that predate the syncretic amalgan precisely what is absent, or at least un recoverable. in the case of Buddhism. <br>
        <i>The authority of the word "Buddhism" lies not in its normative significations so much as in its rhetorical deployments. 
            This indeterminacy forced local Buddhist ecclesiastics to circumscribe orthodoxy and othorpraxis by juxtaposing Buddhism with the heterodox teachings of their imeediate rivals: 
            All self-conscious religious traditions define themselves through contradistinctions with the beliefs and practices of their neighbors.</i> <br>
        The unity of the three creeds (san-chiao ho-i) <br>
        misleading to conceive of the signification of Buddhism in terms of a dialogue between two discrete cultural traditions: <br>
        - dialogue is one sided <br>
        - Buddhism is construed in terms that compromise its descriptive value and analytic leverage <br>

        <br>
        The problem with cross-cultural transmission and translation: the Chinese preferred to translate foreign terms and concepts, creating sinitic neologisms when necessary <br>
        The nature of Chinese orthography: one cannot read the Chinese script aloud without actually knowing the language <br>
        <br>
    </p>

    <h3>Teiser 3-42</h3>

    <h3>Prompt</h3>
    <p>
        Sharf argues that there is no "normative" Buddhism, which is why he is skeptical about the frame that denies Chinese Buddhism. However, I agree with the view that the Chinese never truly understood Indian Buddhism. Instead, they developed their own interpretation based on Chinese cultural traditions. I think the reason why these religious traditions come together so well is largely due to the fact that the "Chinese" version of Buddhism shares lots of similarities with local religions such as Taoism. In fact, Chinese Buddhism is more like a local religion developed upon the skeleton of Indian Buddhism. For example, Buddhism and Taoism share extremely similar ideas on renunciation. As for conflicts, few can be found among the three creeds due to syncretism. This is not only because there were inaccurate translations, but also because in order to survive on this land, Indian Buddhism had to embrace sinification. For example, the Chinese Buddhists twisted their narratives on leaving their families to tailor to the Confucian view of filial piety. This syncretism is more obvious among the masses who are less educated to interpret the original Indian Buddhist scripts, which is why we need to look closer at popular practices. It suggests that the lay/pro divide in China exists largely due to the knowledge gap between the masses and the elites, as the masses do not have access to the more accurately translated written scripts as the elites do. <br>
