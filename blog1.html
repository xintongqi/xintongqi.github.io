    <h1>The Conquest of Happiness</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This is a book that I just read this past summer. 
            I don't know if it sounds stupid or not, 
            but I'd assume that there was a time when everyone wondered what exactly it was that they wanted for their lives, 
            and that was exactly when I came across this book, looking for meanings, answers, and...an ultimate recipe for happiness.
            <br>
            But let's first be clear about something.
            It is not that, I am UNHAPPY. 
            Unhappy is a big word, and I don't think I deserve to use it upon my life.
            No, that's simply not the case. 
            I had a happy childhood, carefree and loved. 
            My teenage time was ok, grinding the textbooks for GaoKao, the one and only exam in China. Sounds scary but it turned out lots of fun.
            Well I blew it up, but that was also ok. I left myself in sorrow for a few days, but then it just began to get better.
            Cool. I landed in Hong Kong, and finally got myself into Columbia.
            <br>
            Overall, I wouldn't call myself unhappy, because it is simply not fair to say so. 
            But when I ask myself, ARE YOU HAPPY? I hesitate to give an answer.
            <br>
            And I keep wondering, why? My life seems totally fine, but why do I hesitate to say that I'm happy? 
            The truth is that, my life is neither unhappy nor happy. It is somewhere in the middle, the grey area.
            <br>
            So, Russell, the great mathematician and logician, what can you tell me about happiness?
        </p>

        <h2>Different Reasons of Unhappiness</h2>
        <p>
            Two factors of unhappiness: social system and individual psychology. <br>
            <br>
            External discipline is the only road to happiness for those unfortunates whose self-absorption is too profound to be cured in any other way. <br>
            There are three kinds of self-absorption <br>
            - sinner: constantly feel sinned, and feel that what they do disgrade themselves, and thus do nothing. <br>
            - narcissist: wish to be admired. <br>
            - megalomaniac: admire power, largely due to the fact that they were once humuliated. <br>
            The latter two types believe that happiness does exist. <br>
            <br>
            All serious success in work depends on some genuine interest in the material with which the work is concerned. <br>
            <br>
            A typical unhappy man: <br>
            deprived in youth of some normal satisfaction <br>
            => value it more than everything <br>
            => live a "one-sided direction" life + undue emphasis upon the achievement as opposed to the activities connected with it <br>
            <br>
            seeks no form of satisfaction but only distraction and oblivion will only make life bearable by becoming less alive <br>
        </p>
