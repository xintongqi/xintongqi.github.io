    <h1>The Conquest of Happiness</h1>
    <p>
        This is a book that I just read this past summer. I don't know if it sounds stupid or not, but I'd assume that there was a time for everyone when they wondered what exactly it was that they needed to get out of their lives, and that is exactly when I came across this book, looking for meanings, looking for answers, and...looking for happiness.
        <br>
        It is not that, I am UNHAPPY. Unhappy is a big word, and I don't think I deserve to use it upon my life. No, that's simply not the case. I had a happy childhood, carefree and loved. My teenage time was ok, grinding the textbooks for GaoKao, the one and only exam in China. I blew up, which was also ok. Cool. And I landed in Hong Kong, and got myself into Columbia now.
        <br>
        Overall, I wouldn't call myself unhappy, because it is simply not fair. But when I ask myself, ARE YOU HAPPY? I hesitate to give an answer.
        <br>
        And I keep wondering, why? My life seems totally fine, but why I hesitate to say that I'm happy?
