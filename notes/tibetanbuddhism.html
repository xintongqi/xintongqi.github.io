        <h2 id="dharma">1. Buddha and Dharma: The Individual Vehicle</h2>
        <h3>1.2 The matrix of civilization</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>three aims of life:
                <ul>
                    <li>kama: pleasure</li>
                    <li>artha: wealth and power</li>
                    <li>dharma: religious duty, law, or custom</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>the fourth aim: moksha: liberation from the cycle of rebirth</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.3 Axial age</h3>
        There are many social reformers during the axial age when people try to figure out what civilization is about.
        For example, the Buddha, Confucius, Laozi, and Socrates. <br>
        Some problems they want to address are:
        <ul>
            <li>militarism and materialism: growing merchant and warrior classes</li>
            <li>elitism and political cynicism: upper-class ossified</li>
            <li>traditionalism and ritualistic formulation: follow the ancestors</li>
            <li>proletarianisation and cultural alienation: the majority of people are alienated from rituals</li>
        </ul>
        Their responses to these four problems:
        <ul>
            <li>moral sensitivity and ethical dualism: target the merchant and warrior classes</li>
            <li>existential humanism and internal transformation: humans need to be more "human"</li>
            <li>historical nemesis and reinterpretation: hold up an <u>ideal</u> ancestor, not just repeating some rigid
                patterns set by the ancestors</li>
            <li>individual and universal social amelioration through scientific and moral education</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>1.6 The buddha and Jesus</h3>
        Several similarities between the Buddha and Jesus:
        <ul>
            <li>Both born without father's seed (very common theme), abandon father's procession</li>
            <li>Both local gods (adapt to local traditions)</li>
            <li>Both overcome the temptations of the devil</li>
            <li>Both dedicated to teaching</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.7 Dharma</h3>
        Dharma has both the meaning of maintaining and transcending. <br>
        The Buddha called his teaching “Dharma.” According to Buddhist scholars, this Sanskrit word has at least eleven
        different meanings, ranging from quality, thing, custom, duty, religion, and law to teaching, virtuous practice,
        the path, and the reality taught, the highest being nirvana itself—freedom from suffering.

        <h3>1.8 Four noble truths</h3>
        The four noble truths are:
        <ul>
            <li>suffering</li>
            <li>the cause of suffering is understandable</li>
            <li>the end of suffering is attainable (nirvana) <br>
                wisdom (prajna): super-knowledge; discriminating knowledge, intuitive apprehension; experiencing the
                true nature of things; acute knowing -> leads to nirvana, and end of suffering</li>
            <li>the path to the end of suffering is the eightfold path</li>
        </ul>
        The four reliances are:
        <ul>
            <li>rely on the teaching not the teacher</li>
            <li>rely on the meaning not the words</li>
            <li>rely on the definitive meaning, not the interpretable meaning</li>
            <li>rely on non-dual experiental wisdom, not on dualistic conceptual knowledge</li>
        </ul>
        These are not dogmas to believe, but things to understand. <br>
        <i>
            The buddha also made it clear this path of salvation is not for everyone. <br>
            This is NOT for ordinary people who think that the little bit of happiness that they occasionally get from
            their anxieties is real happiness.
            This is NOT for self-centered people who just learn like apprentices to do whatever profession their father
            or mother did, and make a living.
            This is NOT for people whose egotism makes them believe that this life they inherit is natural and
            inevitable, and that total freedom from suffering is unrealistic and boring. <br>
            This is another kind of education, a liberating one that leads to <b>true bliss</b>.
        </i>

        <h3>1.9, 1.11-1.13 Three higher education</h3>
        The three higher education encompass the eightfold path. <br>
        You need to educate yourself: when you walk barefoot and get hurt, it is easier to put on shoes rather than to
        cover the entire earch with leather.
        <ul>
            <li>Wisdom: accurate knowledge of the reality - emptiness <br>
                Emptiness is not nothingness, not voidness. <br>
                You're not dissociated from the world, but rather you see
                the nature of this world and you truly understand it.
                You realize that all sentient beings are interconnected. <br>
                Ignorance is the source of all suffering.
            </li>
            <li>Ethical morality: disciplined body, mind and speech <br>
                Rather than ethics, this is more about skills and disciplines. <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Disciplined body: <br>
                        It is unskillful to take life; to steal or take what is not given; to use sexuality in a harmful
                        way. <br>
                        It is skillful to save life; to give gifts; to use sexuality in a lovingly, beneficial way.
                    </li>
                    <li>Disciplined mind: <br>
                        It is unskillful to covet; to be jealous; to lust after something someone else has; to hate, be
                        malicious, or thinking of harming; to be imprisoned in unrealistic view. <br>
                        It is skillful to be generous; to be detached; to love what one has; to enjoy, appreciate and
                        admire other people; to have an open realistic mind.
                    </li>
                    <li>Disciplined speech: <br>
                        It is unskillful to lie; to speak divisively; to speak harshly; to speak meaninglessly. <br>
                        It is skillful to speak truth; to speak reconcilingly; to speak sweetly; to speak
                        meaningfully.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Mental cultivation: higher power of mind through mediation <br>
                Wisdom tell you the world is not always how you feel about it. Ethical morality prepares you for mental
                breakthrough. And finally, you need to meditate.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <div>
        <h2 id="sangha">2. The Mendicant Sangha and the Cool Revolution</h2>
        <h3>2.1-2.4 The sangha</h3>
        At first the buddha does not want to set rules for the sangha, because he thinks rules means hierarchy.
        But later he establishes some rules, and insists that in the sangha people are only ranked by seniority. <br>
        <br>
        The monks in a sangha are not to be understood as monks in Christianity. They are more like mendicants. <br>
        <br>
        At first the sangha does not accept women, not because the buddha thinks women are not able to attain
        enlightenment, but because he is worried that the social system will act against them if more women leave their
        homes to join the sangha. Since the sangha are mendicants, they need to be fed on the excess from the social
        system. <br>
        In fact, the buddha believes that women are more likely to attain enlightenment, because they are physically
        more resilient (childbirth, etc.).<br>
        <br>
        Rather than conquering other people, the sangha chooses to conquer themselves.
        Thus they are vulnerable to military attacks. But this is a path they choose.

        <h3>2.5 Realizational teaching: the eightfold path</h3>
        Wisdom comes not from knowledge, but from experience. The world itself is realizational.
        <ul>
            <li>Realistic worldview: everything is empty. But by emptiness we don't mean nothingness, it means
                everything is relative, there is no absolute fixed self. We exist, but we exist only in relations.
            </li>
            <li>Realistic life purpose</li>
            <li>Realistic speech</li>
            <li>Evolutionary action</li>
            <li>livelihood</li>
            <li>Realistic creative effort</li>
            <li>Realistic mindful awareness</li>
            <li>Realistic concetnration (meditation)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.8 Basic principles of enlightenment by King Ashoka</h3>
        King Ashoka was a conquerer and expanded his reign with brutal wars. But later he renounced killing and became a
        major sponsor of buddhism and the sangha, and this period is known as the cool revolution. <br>
        After his generation, it backlashed, his descendants were not as supportive.
        <ol>
            <li>Transcendental individualism: acknowledge the individual's happiness over the collective need of
                society. The collective society's highest goal is for each individual to achieve supreme happiness
            </li>
            <li>Non-violence: no harm to each other, no harm to animals</li>
            <li>Educationalism: education is not only for professional life, but also a means to transform oneself.
                education is itself the highest purpose, rather than preparing oneself for the highest purpose.
                "Truth conquest". meditation is important
            </li>
            <li>Social altruism: others are as important or even more important than oneself</li>
            <li>Demoncratic universalism: within the sangha, kings, aristocratics, are the same as everyone</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2 id="mahayana">3. Mahayana: The Universal Vehicle</h2>
        Majority of buddhism sutras believe that the buddha himself is the inventor of the universal vehicle, but he
        insisted that only after a few centuries can it be published when the Indian society had gone through some
        changes. And Nagarjuna, a monk, was chosen to publish it. He lived hundreds of years. <br>
        <h3>3.2 Universal vehicle vs Individual vehicle</h3>
        The universal vehicle does not contradict the individual vehicle: they share the same three jewels, the same
        four noble truths, the same three education. <br>
        Difference is that the individual vehicle uses them to achieve individual enlightenment, universal vehicle
        pressures each individual to assist the enlightenment of the collective whole. <br>
        Nagarjuna's statement: Śūnyatā-Karunā-garbhaṃ, which means "emptiness (or voidness) is the root of compassion."
        When you realize the emptiness of yourself, you start to be compassionate and see others.
        <h3>3.7, 3.8 Core Idea of Universal Vehicle Movement: Wisdom and Compassion</h3>
        Prajna: sharp intelligence, wisdom <br>
        Selflessness: the experience of failing to identify the unique, unchanging thing about yourself. And we as human
        beings have to cope with that feeling of failure <br>
        <i>Speaking of this, I find the common theme of religion and philosophy is identifying oneself and attributing
            meanings to oneself. Really, everyone is trying to find something unchanging, and the easiest way might be
            looking within oneself, thus people look for persona, for existential stuff, and now these buddhists are
            telling you there is no such thing lol</i><br>
        Compassion: the buddha and bodhisattva cannot directly end your suffering, unless you get yourself out
        <ul>
            <li>false/merely compassion: sympathetic thoughts about others without remedies</li>
            <li>compassion that sees beings: combined with wisdom of impermanence, it helps alleviate suffering of
                others</li>
            <li>compassion that sees processes: combined with wisdom of personal/subjective selflessness, it sees the
                current state the person is in</li>
            <li>universal compassion: combined with wisdom of objective selflessness, it sees no object, there is no
                boundary between oneself and other</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2 id="vajrayana">4. Vajrayana: The Esoteric Vehicle</h2>
        The esoteric vehicle developed during a period that the Indian society was developed enough and peaceful enough
        for people to practice meditation and citing mantras.
        <h3>4.3 Buddhist monastic universities</h3>
        In Tibetan, a buddhist means an inner-nist, someone who studies the inner world.
        <ul>
            <li>logic epistemology (pramana): analytical skills to understand and formulate terms</li>
            <li>experiential wisdom (madhyamika): practical skills</li>
            <li>transcendental wisdom (prajnaparamita): mental concentration and personal wellbeing. the nerve system is
                like a machine that can be controlled. you need to discover a sense of substantial presence within
                yourself. </li>
            <li>karmic biology: kosmology, astronomy, super-teaching -> used to develop the technology of "lucid
                dreaming"</li>
            <li>ethics: the behavioral manual of the mendicants and lay people</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>4.6-4.7 Seven-fold Causal Instruction</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>imagine all beings as your mother</li>
            <li>remember the kindness of your mother and seek that kindness in others</li>
            <li>wish to repay kindness</li>
            <li>wish other people to feel relaxed, happy, secured</li>
            <li>recognize suffering of others and feel compassionate towards them</li>
            <li>universal responsibility: be the agent to relieve their sufferings and bring them happiness</li>
            <li>take the bodhisattva vow</li>
        </ul>
        The Dalai Lama said he had difficulty picturing other people as his mother when he was little, so instead he did
        this: extending compassion through exchange of self and others <br>
        Instead of thinking "what do I want", "what makes me happy", think less about "I" and more about others. <br>
        When you stop thinking about yourself and start thinking "what makes other people happy", the first person whom
        you make happy and releave from
        suffering is yourself. <br>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2 id="tibet">5-6 Tibetan Buddhism</h2>
        The buddhist were actively seeking a place to transmit their culture, and Tibet was chosen due to its
        individualism, non-violence, educationalism, social altruism, egalitarian universalism.
        <h3>5.1-5.3 The Buddhification Process</h3>
        Tibet transformed from imperial militarism (dominated by military) to mass monasticism (academia) in the
        buddhification process. <br>
        The process started and ended with the Tibetan empire, and two translators Rinchen Zangpo and Atisha introduced
        Indian sutras into Tibet. <br>
        This process is demilitarizing the country.
        <h3>5.6-5.7 Dalai Lamas</h3>
        Dalai means the ocean in Mongolian. <br>
        Early Dalai Lamas 15-17th centuries: the 1st to 4th Dalai Lamas; they reincarnate and keep on transmitting
        buddhism. The 4th Dalai Lama was actually born in Mongolia not Tibet, due to social unrest in Tibet. His
        disciple was the king of Mongolia, who helped him bring together Tibet. <br>
        The 5th Dalai Lama: The Potala Palace was first built in the 7th century by Tibetan King Songtsen Gampo as a
        royal residence, but the grand structure seen today was reconstructed and expanded in the 17th century under the
        direction of the 5th Dalai Lama, who made it the spiritual and political center of Tibet, adding the iconic
        White Palace and Red Palace.
        <h3>5.7 Inner Modernism</h3>
        Western outer modernism:
        <ul>
            <li>life-world unified by secularization</li>
            <li>disenchantment of the natural</li>
            <li>the rationalization of all human effort in the goal of maximizing human comfort</li>
            <li>the absolutization of material progress</li>
            <li>the destruction of effort toward the sacred represented by monasticism</li>
        </ul>
        Tibetan inner modernism:
        <ul>
            <li>life-world unified by sacralization: the sacred gradually absorbing the secular</li>
            <li>reenchantment of the natural</li>
            <li>the rationalization of all human effort in the goal of individual attainment of revolutionary perfection
                in buddhahood: wisdom and compassion</li>
            <li>the absolutization of spiritual progress</li>
            <li>monasticism is dominant</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>6.1-6.3 Tibet’s Mainstream Millennial Culture</h3>
        Tibetans no longer maintain any ancestral rituals like people do in China and India, as a direct consequence of
        believing in reincarnations. <br>
        Tibet’s unique sociological qualities:
        <ul>
            <li>universalization of ancestor feelings</li>
            <li>loss of taste for war</li>
            <li>sense of imminence of enlightened beings</li>
        </ul>
