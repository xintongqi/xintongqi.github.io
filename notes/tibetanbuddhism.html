        <h3>1.2 The matrix of civilization</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>three aims of life:
                <ul>
                    <li>kama: pleasure</li>
                    <li>artha: wealth and power</li>
                    <li>dharma: religious duty, law, or custom</li>
                </ul>
                the fourth aim: moksha: liberation from the cycle of rebirth
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.3 Axial age</h3>
        There are many social reformers during the axial age when people try to figure out what civilization is about.
        For example, the Buddha, Confucius, Laozi, and Socrates. <br>
        Some problems they want to address are:
        <ul>
            <li>militarism and materialism: growing merchant and warrior classes</li>
            <li>elitism and political cynicism: upper-class ossified</li>
            <li>traditionalism and ritualistic formulation: follow the ancestors</li>
            <li>proletarianisation and cultural alienation: the majority of people are alienated from rituals</li>
        </ul>
        Their responses to these four problems:
        <ul>
            <li>moral sensitivity and ethical dualism: target the merchant and warrior classes</li>
            <li>existential humanism and internal transformation: humans need to be more "human"</li>
            <li>historical nemesis and reinterpretation: hold up an <u>ideal</u> ancestor, not just repeating some rigid
                patterns set by the ancestors</li>
            <li>individual and universal social amelioration through scientific and moral education</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>1.6 The buddha and Jesus</h3>
        Several similarities between the Buddha and Jesus:
        <ul>
            <li>Both born without father's seed (very common theme), abandon father's procession</li>
            <li>Both local gods (adapt to local traditions)</li>
            <li>Both overcome the temptations of the devil</li>
            <li>Both dedicated to teaching</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.7 Dharma</h3>
        Dharma has both the meaning of maintaining and transcending. <br>
        The Buddha called his teaching “Dharma.” According to Buddhist scholars, this Sanskrit word has at least eleven
        different meanings, ranging from quality, thing, custom, duty, religion, and law to teaching, virtuous practice,
        the path, and the reality taught, the highest being nirvana itself—freedom from suffering.

        <h3>1.8 Four noble truths</h3>
        The four noble truths are:
        <ul>
            <li>suffering</li>
            <li>the cause of suffering is understandable</li>
            <li>the end of suffering is attainable (nirvana) <br>
                wisdom (prajna): super-knowledge; discriminating knowledge, intuitive apprehension; experiencing the
                true nature of things; acute knowing -> leads to nirvana, and end of suffering</li>
            <li>the path to the end of suffering is the eightfold path</li>
        </ul>
        The four reliances are:
        <ul>
            <li>rely on the teaching not the teacher</li>
            <li>rely on the meaning not the words</li>
            <li>rely on the definitive meaning, not the interpretable meaning</li>
            <li>rely on non-dual experiental wisdom, not on dualistic conceptual knowledge</li>
        </ul>
        These are not dogmas to believe, but things to understand. <br>
        <i>
            The buddha also made it clear this path of salvation is not for everyone. <br>
            This is NOT for ordinary people who think that the little bit of happiness that they occasionally get from
            their anxieties is real happiness.
            This is NOT for self-centered people who just learn like apprentices to do whatever profession their father
            or mother did, and make a living.
            This is NOT for people whose egotism makes them believe that this life they inherit is natural and
            inevitable, and that total freedom from suffering is unrealistic and boring. <br>
            This is another kind of education, a liberating one that leads to <b>true bliss</b>.
        </i>

        <h3>1.9, 1.11-1.13 Three higher education</h3>
        The three higher education encompass the eightfold path. <br>
        You need to educate yourself: when you walk barefoot and get hurt, it is easier to put on shoes rather than to
        cover the entire earch with leather.
        <ul>
            <li>Wisdom: accurate knowledge of the reality - emptiness <br>
                Emptiness is not nothingness, not voidness. <br>
                You're not dissociated from the world, but rather you see
                the nature of this world and you truly understand it.
                You realize that all sentient beings are interconnected. <br>
                Ignorance is the source of all suffering.
            </li>
            <li>Ethical morality: disciplined body, mind and speech <br>
                Rather than ethics, this is more about skills and disciplines. <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Disciplined body: <br>
                        It is unskillful to take life; to steal or take what is not given; to use sexuality in a harmful
                        way. <br>
                        It is skillful to save life; to give gifts; to use sexuality in a lovingly, beneficial way.
                    </li>
                    <li>Disciplined mind: <br>
                        It is unskillful to covet; to be jealous; to lust after something someone else has; to hate, be
                        malicious, or thinking of harming; to be imprisoned in unrealistic view. <br>
                        It is skillful to be generous; to be detached; to love what one has; to enjoy, appreciate and
                        admire other people; to have an open realistic mind.
                    </li>
                    <li>Disciplined speech: <br>
                        It is unskillful to lie; to speak divisively; to speak harshly; to speak meaninglessly. <br>
                        It is skillful to speak truth; to speak reconcilingly; to speak sweetly; to speak
                        meaningfully.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Mental cultivation: higher power of mind through mediation <br>
                Wisdom tell you the world is not always how you feel about it. Ethical morality prepares you for mental
                breakthrough. And finally, you need to meditate.
            </li>
        </ul>
