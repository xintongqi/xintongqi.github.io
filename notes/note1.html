        <h1 id="key">KEY TERMS</h1>
        <p>
            The following are key terms from East Asian Buddhism. <br>
            Each of them follows a three dimensional definition of what it is, its historical context and how it relates to Buddhism. <br>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Vedas</b><br>
                    A group of text concerned about proper behavior. Transmitted orally. Written in Sanskrit. <br>
                    This is a pre-buddhism term from the Indo-Aryan culture. <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Aryans</b><br>
                    A group of people who invaded ancient India and shaped the Indian culture. <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Lay People</b><br>
                    Buddhists that are not monks, and live a household life. <br>
                    The connection between lay people and the buddha is established through worships and giving. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Brahmin</b><br>
                    According to the division of labors, Brahmins are religious professionals commited to transmitting the vedas.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Mantra</b><br>
                    Mantras associate words with power. Lots of them derived from scriptures.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Upanishads</b><br>
                    A set of stores about the beginning of India.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Samsara</b><br>
                    Samsara refers to the cycle of birth, life, death, and rebirth. <br>
                    This is a pre-buddhism term.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Karma</b><br>
                    The cosmic law to which the devas are subject to. Originally means ritual actions can cause effects.
                    Later means cause and effect. <br>
                    Three laws about Karma: <br>
                    The cause is always related to the effect and vice versa. <br>
                    The cause is always greater than the effect because it produces the effect. <br>
                    The effect always exists in cause until it comes to existence on its own. i.e. the effect is a latent potentiality. <br>
                    Karma is not particular to Buddhism. It is a pre-buddhism term. <br>
                    The buddhists think multiple causes lead to one effect, and that there are multiple or infinite effects caused by one cause. <br>
                    Also, karma is restricted to mental causes and effects under the buddhist context. <br>
                    <i>Karmic Stream</i> <br>
                    Because the body is impermanent, there are far more causes produced than effects experienced, which form a karmic stream.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Transmigration / Reincarnation / Rebirth</b><br>
                    Under Buddhist context: when there is no more effect to take, one reaches nirvana and stops reincarnation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Eightfold Noble Path</b><br>
                    Right view, right resolve, right speech, right conduct, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right samadhi <br>
                    The fourth nobel truth states that the way to eliminate suffering is the eightfold noble path.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Asceticism / Renunciation</b><br>
                    Renunciation of pleasures and cultivation of pains in pursuit of clearity of thoughts and spiritual goals. <br>
                    The practice adopted by the sramanas before Buddhism.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Atman</b><br>
                    The eternal soul. The ultimate goal of the sramanas, who believe that you can achieve eternal soal if you practice asceticism.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Buddha</b><br>
                    The one whose death marks the birth of Buddhism. <br>
                    The stories of his previous reincarnations are noted in Jataka tales and he gained enlightenment in his final life as a prince. <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Bodhisattva</b><br>
                    Anyone who takes a vow to save others before reaching nirvana is on the path of Bodhisattva. <br>
                    This is a term specific to Mahayana Buddhism. <br>
                    <i>However, note that there is still clear lay-pro distinction even if everyone can be Bodhisattva.</i>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Meditation</b><br>
                    Meditation is a process that is believed to bring clearity of thoughts. <br>
                    It is adopted by both the sramanas and the buddhists. And the Buddha also took this practice when he was in the forest.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Siddhartha</b><br>
                    The name of the Buddha.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Jataka Tales</b><br>
                    Tales of the previous reincarnations of the Buddha. <br>
                    In these stories, he is a lay man instead of a professional with superhuman compassion, which indicates that good deeds can be done by anyone, and that what you do right now as a lay person is important.
                    In order to obtain the ultimate wisdom, you must have compassion. <br>
                    => Compassion and lay practices fit together natually. You need many lifetimes of compassion to become a Buddha. <br>
                    All sentient beings are on the same path, but not at the same pace.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Sramana</b><br>
                    A group of people who practice asceticism in pursuit of the atman. "Your soal is eternal, but your body vanishes." <br>
                    They introduced the term reincarnation. <br>
                    They see karma as the chain that binds us to this world. "By taking effects, you are chained." <br>
                    They also see karma as the spiritual dust that need to get rid of. <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Cakravartin Prophecy</b><br>
                    A prophecy made upon the birth of the Buddha, that he will either conquer the material world or the spiritual world. <br>
                    Demonstrates the duality between material and spiritual world.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Four Visions / Sights / Encounters</b><br>
                    Old age, sickness, death and the sramana. <br>
                    Before becoming the Buddha, the prince saw a man of old age, a sick man, a corpse and a sramana, from whom he first realized that suffering existed. <br>
                    These people are disguised by the devas, who needed the Buddha to attain enlightenment so that he could guide them in the spiritual world if they fall. <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Four Noble Truths</b><br>
                    All is suffering. <br>
                    There are causes to the suffering. <br>
                    There is a way to eliminate the causes of suffering. <br>
                    The way to eliminate suffering is the Eightfold Noble Path. <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Suffering</b> (Sanskrit: duhkha, Pali: dukkha)<br>
                    suffering = attachments + delusions <br>
                    Either will make you suffer, and they feed each other. <br>
                    The greatest delusion of all is the delusion of self, of the existence of Atman. <br>
                    Suffering is different from pain. The former is mental while the latter is physical. You feel the pain, but you don't suffer. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Middle Way</b><br>
                    The middle way means a balance between extreme asceticism and too much indulgence into the material world. <br>
                    During his life in forest, the Buddha decides that extreme asceticism is simply counter human dignity, and that you will become attach to it. <br>
                    Too much asceticism is not the answer to enlightenment and wisdom. Instead, the answer is the middle way.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Sujata</b><br>
                    An Indian girl who offered rice water to the buddha when he was practicing asceticism in the forest.
                    After drinking the rice water, the buddha attained enlightenment. <br>
                    This story marks the lay-pro distinction: lay people give (compassion oriented), and pros meditate (wisdom oriented). It also suggests what you do as a lay person matters.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Nirvana</b><br>
                    Nirvana means extinction and cessation. It is a state that you reach once you work off the karma 
                </li>

                    <b>Vimalakirti</b><br>
                    A lay person who practices Mahayana Buddhism. <br>
                    When the pros try to argue with him with his understanding on Mahayana Buddhism, he answered in silence.

                    <b>Death of the Buddha (Parinirvana)</b><br>
                    The buddha died after eating a piece of meat offered by a blacksmith. He felt the pain but did not suffer. 
                    He didn't fight his death because he acknowledged all is impermanent, and he had no attachment to himself.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Dharma (Pali: Dhamma)</b><br>
                    The Buddha's teachings on suffering, impermanence, no-self, karma, etc. <br>
                    It is one of the three treasures of Buddhism. <br>
                    After the birth of Mahayana, there was the exploding canon where all sorts of Mahayana sciptures were discovered. <br>
                    Unlike Arhat Buddhists, the Mahayana people use these scriptures to gain more karma through chanting. This is referred to as the karmic engines.
                </li>

                    <b>Sangha</b><br>
                    The religious group, the pros. <br>
                    The Sangha is one of the three treasures of Buddhism. The term is set up after the death of the Buddha. <br>
                    After the birth of Mahayana, the lay-pro divide was blurred since everyone could be a Bodhisattva.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Vinaya</b><br>
                    A group of texts that set down in detail what a pro can or cannot do.  <br>
                    It is drafted after the death of the Buddha when divergence emerged, so the senior monks organized councils to standardize ethics for monks. <br>
                    <i>Vinaya are not scriptures. Scriptures specifically refer to the Buddha's teaching.</i>
                </li>

                    Mahayana: the three bodies of the Buddha (historical, bliss body, greate non-dual substance), Dharma (exploding canon, karmic engine), Sangha (blurring lay-pro divide, Bodhisattva)

                <li>
                    <b>Skillful Means</b><br>
                    Everyone is at a different stage. You need to tailor the teaching to reach them where they are. <br>
                    The Buddha realized this during the first sermon after he gained enlightenment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Doctrine of Two Truths</b><br>
                    To teach Buddhism one has to use language, but language is only the provisional truth. <br>
                    The absolute truth is non-duality and emptiness.

                    The idea of the vow is to save everyone else in this world before you gain nirvana. <br>
                    It is a product of the Mahayana Buddhism, and demonstrates the power of language. <br>

                    A term used in Chinese cosmology. <br>
                    Qi is uncreated, inherently unstable, resonant. It cannot be made or destroyed. It can be less or more refined. <br>
                    Also, it can be viewed as Yin or Yang.

                    They read from the cracks on the bones, after which they would carve into the bones the questions they ask and the answers they get. <br>
                    This is only done for the ruler and his family.

                    You can't have only Yin or Yang. They are not opposites but complement each other.

                    Ghost festival was invented by the Chinese during an extremely chaotic period where there were constant wars (late Han Dynasty). 
                    At that time, people believe that China is run be demons. 
                    A story about a monk Mu-lien is thus invented, in which the Buddha sets up a ghost festival so that the dead can reunite with their family for three days each year when the Sangha chant to open the gate of hell.
                    This shows how the Buddhists interposed themselves into the Chinese filial piety culture and evolved into a ritually oriented religion.

                    An image of the Dharma king who would sponsor Dharma and delay the apocalypse was thus created. <br>
                    It marks the first breakthrough between the Indian and Chinese Buddhism.

        <p><b>The Period of Preparation</b><br>
            preconditions of the spread of the influence of Buddhism in China: <br>
            make the Chinese of all classes responsive to new ideas and institutions, particularly those of alien origin <br>
            make Buddhism go through the preliminary process of adaptation <br>
            <br>

            <b>Humanizing of Confucianism</b><br>
            struggle among the four groups (the entrenched great families, the eunuchs, the nouveaux riches and the intelligntsia) => conflicting power interests => naturalistic critique of Han Confucianism <br>
            reluctant to renounce all the principles of order, hierarchy and stability which that synthesis had provided <br>
            turned to the long-neglected classics of Taoism => no positive means of restoring a viable society (pure escapism, cynical peace with the corrupt tyrants...)<br>
            <i>Yet it was the cataclysm of mass revolt and political collapse which inspired further and more searching attacks on the old orthodoxy, bringing it at last into something like total disrepute</i><br>
            The breakdown of the ecumenical order of the Han permitted the spread of Buddhism throughout the Chinese world <br>
            <br>

            <b>Spread of Buddhism</b><br>
            Buddhism spread from the Indo-Iranian and Serindian kingdoms of Central Asia along the routes of trade <br>
            In China, the religion moved along the main routes of internal trade and communication <br>
            Tun-huang figures early as a Buddhist center <br>
            <br>

            <b>Divergence: China and India</b><br>
            languages: uninflected, logographic, largely monosyllabic, no systematized grammar <i>vs</i> highly inflected, alphabetic, polysyllabic, highly elaborated grammartical system <br>
            literary modes: terseness, metaphors from familiar nature, concrete image <i>vs</i> discursive, hyperbolic in its metaphors, full of abstractions <br>
            attitudes toward the individual: little disposition to analyze the personality into its components <i>vs</i> highly developed science of psychological analysis <br>
            concepts of time and space: think of both as finite and reckon time in life-spans, generations or political eras <i>vs</i> think of both as infinite and think of cosmic eons rather than units of terrestrial life <br>
            *** social and political values: familism and particularistic ethics <i>vs</i> salvation outside the family <br>
                                            concentrated efforts on formulars for the good society <i>vs</i> laid particular stress upon the pursuit of other-worldly goals <br>
            <br>

            <b>Translation</b><br>
            First Mahayana translation accessible and reasonably intelligible: done by Dharmaraksa in 286 <br>
            Confucian and Taoist terms were used to render Buddhist terms. "offensive" words are eliminated <br>
            *** ko-i: matching concepts => choosing a group of Buddhist ideas and matchig them with a plausibly analogous grouping of indigenous ideas <br>
            apologetic writing: defense of the alien system. indicates the greatest conflicts between the two traditions <br>
            <br>

            <b>Early Buddhism and Taoism</b><br>
            Early Buddhism is generally regarded as a sect of religious Taoism. <br>
            <br>

            <i>I do not believe that there is anything in the world more propoer to dispose the spirit and the heart of the Chinese to embrace our holy religion than to make them see how it is in conformaty with their ancient and legitimate philosophy. </i>
            <br><br>

            <b>Typical Chinese Literati Who Turned to Buddhist</b><br>
            early training in Confucian classics <br>
            developed a strong interest in Lao-tzu and Chuang-tzu and achieved mastery in these texts <br>
            one day heard a famous monk lecture <br>
            became a monk, studied and began to preach <br>
            <br>
            
            <b>Mahayana and Hinayana: Subitism (tun) and Gradualism (chien)</b><br>
            Mahayana: after salvation the help of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas and the possibility of a single and sudden moment of enlightenment 
            => Subitism: apprehension of reality in a sudden and complete vision (associated with Taoism)<br>
            Hinayana: prescribe an age-long and arduous accumulation of positive karma leading to ultimate release into nirvana 
            = > Gradualism: approach to the ultimate reality by analysis, the accumulation of long study (associated with Confucianism)<br>
            <br>

            <b>Emperor Wu of the Liang</b><br>
            ordered to forsake Taoism and embrace Buddhism <br>

            new satisfaction for the rich and powerful in the lavish building of temples and retreats in the developing style of Chinese Buddhist architecture <br>
            <br>

            <b>North and South</b><br>
            in the South: Buddhism adjusted to elite and popular culture, interacted with southern philosophical and literary traditions, developed its beliefs and practices in response to the society <br>
            in the North: endless wars. Buddhism was introduced with its superior magical power. Buddhism did not have competition of an entrenched religious Taoism, and the peasantry were converted en masse. <br>
            Buddhist monks from the north migrated to the south and southern monks went north. <br>
            <br>
            
            <b>Kumarajiva</b><br>
            Mahayana Buddhism was presented in Chinese with far greater clarity and precision than ever before <br>
            Sunyata - Nagarjuna's concept of the void - was disentangled from the Taoist terminology <br>

            But what is authentic? what is right? Who would have been in the position to judge?<br>

            <i>To claim privileged access to original or pure Buddhism, whether on the basis of the lineage, knowledge of scripture, meditative discipline, inner purity, or personal insight,

            <b>Reconsider Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism and "syncretism"</b><br>

            that predate the syncretic amalgan precisely what is absent, or at least un recoverable. in the case of Buddhism. <br>
            <i>The authority of the word "Buddhism" lies not in its normative significations so much as in its rhetorical deployments. 
                This indeterminacy forced local Buddhist ecclesiastics to circumscribe orthodoxy and othorpraxis by juxtaposing Buddhism with the heterodox teachings of their imeediate rivals: 
                All self-conscious religious traditions define themselves through contradistinctions with the beliefs and practices of their neighbors.</i> <br>
            The unity of the three creeds (san-chiao ho-i) <br>
            misleading to conceive of the signification of Buddhism in terms of a dialogue between two discrete cultural traditions: <br>
            - dialogue is one sided <br>
            - Buddhism is construed in terms that compromise its descriptive value and analytic leverage <br>

            <br>
            The problem with cross-cultural transmission and translation: the Chinese preferred to translate foreign terms and concepts, creating sinitic neologisms when necessary <br>
            The nature of Chinese orthography: one cannot read the Chinese script aloud without actually knowing the language <br>

        </p>

        <h3>Teiser 3-42</h3>

        <h3>Prompt</h3>
        <p>
            Sharf argues that there is no "normative" Buddhism, which is why he is skeptical about the frame that denies Chinese Buddhism. However, I agree with the view that the Chinese never truly understood Indian Buddhism. Instead, they developed their own interpretation based on Chinese cultural traditions. I think the reason why these religious traditions come together so well is largely due to the fact that the "Chinese" version of Buddhism shares lots of similarities with local religions such as Taoism. In fact, Chinese Buddhism is more like a local religion developed upon the skeleton of Indian Buddhism. For example, Buddhism and Taoism share extremely similar ideas on renunciation. As for conflicts, few can be found among the three creeds due to syncretism. This is not only because there were inaccurate translations, but also because in order to survive on this land, Indian Buddhism had to embrace sinification. For example, the Chinese Buddhists twisted their narratives on leaving their families to tailor to the Confucian view of filial piety. This syncretism is more obvious among the masses who are less educated to interpret the original Indian Buddhist scripts, which is why we need to look closer at popular practices. It suggests that the lay/pro divide in China exists largely due to the knowledge gap between the masses and the elites, as the masses do not have access to the more accurately translated written scripts as the elites do. <br>

        <h3>McRae's Rules of Zen Studies</h3>
        <p>
            - It's not true, and therefore it's more important. "Did it really happen?" <br>
            - Lineage assertions are as wrong as they are strong. "Lineage" under this context is more like teacher and students, but not family lineage. <br>
            - Precision implies inaccuracy. Numbers, dates and other details. The more "precise" they seem to be, the more inaccuracy there is. <br>
            - Romanticism breeds cynicism. Zen romanticists and the apologists for Confucian triumphalism. <br>
            <i>McRae's rules are essentially saying that, history itself is in fact not as important as the narratives.</i> <br>
        </p>

        <h3>McRae, xix-xx, 1-45</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Chan Buddhism</b> <br>
            not posit words, seperate transmission outside the teachings ("不立文字，教外别传；直指人心，见性成佛") <br>
            Chan does not define itself as being one among a number of Buddhist schools based on a particular scripture such as Tiantai with its emphasis on the <i>Lotus Sutra</i> <br>
            the Chan lineage scheme is a combined product of Indian and Chinese culture <br>
            the "most Chinese" of all the Chinese Buddhist schools <br>
            <br>

            <b>Lineage-Based</b> <br>
            Chan practice is fundamentally genealogical (relational: involving interactions, generational: organized, reiterative: intended for repetition) <br> 
            there is no "thing" - such as enlightenment, the Buddha-mind, or whatever - that is actually passed from oen partriah to the next <br>
            the focus is not on "what" is being transmitted, but on the relationship of encounter between the Buddhas and patriahs <br>
            recognition of shared spiritual maturity <br>
            McRae's second rule: the more important it is to the religious identity of the individuals involved, the less accurate it will be <br>
            male-dominated, patriarchal: was Chan a weapon to oppress women within Chinese society <br>
            <br>

            <b>The "String of Pearls" Fallacy</b> <br>
            "string of pearls" fallacy: whenever we pretend to explain Chan in terms of lineal successions from one great master to another <br>

        <h3>Prompt</h3>
        <p>
            I prefer Hui-neng’s interpretation of Buddhism. Shen-hsiu’s verse and Hui-neng’s verse remind me of the concepts of subitism (tun) and gradualism (chien) from the readings last week. In Shen-hsiu’s verse, he mentions that at all times we must strive to polish our mind, which somehow resonates with gradualism, suggesting that the acquisition of wisdom requires significant devotion and effort. As Wrights points out, gradualism reflects certain thinking of the Hinayana people (I know Hinayana is a troubling term but…let’s just use it for a second:), which is to gain nirvana after the accumulation of positive karma. Different from Shen-hsiu, Hui-neng’s verse sounds more like the Mahayana people, who advertise subitism in pursuit of Buddha nature. He says the mind is originally clean, and that we don’t need to worry about it being stained. This correlates with subitism, and suggests that a sudden moment of enlightenment is possible. Also, I feel like Hui-neng’s viewpoint of “not trying” actually shares some similarities with Taoist ideas that things are already in shape, and that we do not need to change or modify  them. Instead, we should just let them be. If we try too hard, we break the middle way and grow attachments and delusions, which push us away from instead of closer to wisdom and enlightenment.
