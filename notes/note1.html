        <h1 id="key">KEY TERMS</h1>
        <p>
            The following are key terms from East Asian Buddhism. <br>
            Each of them follows a three dimensional definition of what it is, its historical context and how it relates to Buddhism. <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Vedas</b><br>
                    A group of text concerned about proper behavior. Transmitted orally. Written in Sanskrit. <br>
                    This is a pre-buddhist term from the Indo-Aryan culture. <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Aryans</b><br>
                    A group of people who invaded ancient India and shaped the Indian culture. <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Lay People</b><br>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Brahmin</b><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Mantra</b><br>
                    Mantras associate words with power. Lots of them derived from scriptures.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Upanishads</b><br>
                    A set of stores about the beginning of India.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Samsara</b><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Karma</b><br>
                    The cosmic law to which the devas are subject to. Originally means ritual actions can cause effects.
                    Later means cause and effect. <br>
                    Three laws about Karma: <br>
                    The cause is always related to the effect and vice versa. <br>
                    The cause is always greater than the effect because it produces the effect. <br>
                    The effect always exists in cause until it comes to existence on its own. i.e. the effect is a latent potentiality. <br>
                    Karma is not particular to Buddhism. It is a pre-buddhist term. <br>
                    The buddhists think multiple causes lead to one effect, and that there are multiple or infinite effects caused by one cause. <br>
                    Also, karma is restricted to mental causes and effects under the buddhist context. <br>
                    <i>Karmic Stream</i> <br>
                    Because the body is impermanent, there are far more causes produced than effects experienced, which form a karmic stream.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Transmigration / Reincarnation / Rebirth</b><br>
                    Under Buddhist context: when there is no more effect to take, one reaches nirvana and stops reincarnation.

                <li>
                    <b>Asceticism / Renunciation</b><br>
                    Renunciation of pleasures and cultivation of pains in pursuit of clearity of thoughts and spiritual goals. <br>
                    The practice adopted by sramanas before Buddhism.

                <li>
                    <b>Atman</b><br>
                    The eternal soul. The ultimate goal of the sramanas, who believe that you can achieve eternal soal if you practice asceticism.

                <li>
                    <b>Jataka Tales</b><br>
                    Tales of the previous reincarnations of the Buddha. <br>
                    In these stories, he is a lay man instead of a professional with superhuman compassion, which indicates that good deeds can be done by anyone, and that what you do right now as a lay person is important.
                    In order to obtain the ultimate wisdom, you must have compassion. <br>
                    => Compassion and lay practices fit together natually. You need many lifetimes of compassion to become a Buddha. <br>
                    All sentient beings are on the same path, but not at the same pace.

                    <b>Sramana</b><br>
                    A group of people who practice asceticism in pursuit of the atman. "Your soal is eternal, but your body vanishes." <br>
                    They introduced the term reincarnation. <br>
                    They see karma as the chain that binds us to this world. "By taking effects, you are chained." <br>
                    They also see karma as the spiritual dust that need to get rid of. <br>

                <li>
                    <b>Cakravartin Prophecy</b><br>
                    A prophecy made upon the birth of the Buddha, that he will either conquer the material world or the spiritual world. <br>
                    Demonstrates the duality between material and spiritual world.

                    <b>Four Visions / Sights / Encounters</b><br>
                    Old age, sickness, death and the sramana. <br>
                    Before becoming the Buddha, the prince saw a man of old age, a sick man, a corpse and a sramana, from whom he first realized that suffering existed. <br>
                    These people are disguised by the devas, who needed the Buddha to attain enlightenment so that he could guide them in the spiritual world if they fall. <br>

                <li>
                    <b>Four Noble Truths</b><br>
                    All is suffering. <br>
                    There are causes to the suffering. <br>
                    There is a way to eliminate the causes of suffering. <br>
                    The way to eliminate suffering is the Eightfold Noble Path. <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Suffering</b> (Sanskrit: duhkha, Pali: dukkha)<br>
                    suffering = attachments + delusions <br>
                    Either will make you suffer, and they feed each other. <br>
                    The greatest delusion of all is the delusion of self, of the existence of Atman. <br>
                    Suffering is different from pain. The former is mental while the latter is physical. You feel the pain, but you don't suffer.

        <p><b>The Period of Preparation</b><br>
            preconditions of the spread of the influence of Buddhism in China: <br>
            make the Chinese of all classes responsive to new ideas and institutions, particularly those of alien origin <br>
            make Buddhism go through the preliminary process of adaptation <br>
            <br>

            <b>Humanizing of Confucianism</b><br>
            struggle among the four groups (the entrenched great families, the eunuchs, the nouveaux riches and the intelligntsia) => conflicting power interests => naturalistic critique of Han Confucianism <br>
            reluctant to renounce all the principles of order, hierarchy and stability which that synthesis had provided <br>
            turned to the long-neglected classics of Taoism => no positive means of restoring a viable society (pure escapism, cynical peace with the corrupt tyrants...)<br>
            <i>Yet it was the cataclysm of mass revolt and political collapse which inspired further and more searching attacks on the old orthodoxy, bringing it at last into something like total disrepute</i><br>
            The breakdown of the ecumenical order of the Han permitted the spread of Buddhism throughout the Chinese world <br>
            <br>

            <b>Spread of Buddhism</b><br>
            Buddhism spread from the Indo-Iranian and Serindian kingdoms of Central Asia along the routes of trade <br>
            In China, the religion moved along the main routes of internal trade and communication <br>
            Tun-huang figures early as a Buddhist center <br>
            <br>

            <b>Divergence: China and India</b><br>
            languages: uninflected, logographic, largely monosyllabic, no systematized grammar <i>vs</i> highly inflected, alphabetic, polysyllabic, highly elaborated grammartical system <br>
            literary modes: terseness, metaphors from familiar nature, concrete image <i>vs</i> discursive, hyperbolic in its metaphors, full of abstractions <br>
            attitudes toward the individual: little disposition to analyze the personality into its components <i>vs</i> highly developed science of psychological analysis <br>
            concepts of time and space: think of both as finite and reckon time in life-spans, generations or political eras <i>vs</i> think of both as infinite and think of cosmic eons rather than units of terrestrial life <br>
            *** social and political values: familism and particularistic ethics <i>vs</i> salvation outside the family <br>
                                            concentrated efforts on formulars for the good society <i>vs</i> laid particular stress upon the pursuit of other-worldly goals <br>
            <br>

            <b>Translation</b><br>
            First Mahayana translation accessible and reasonably intelligible: done by Dharmaraksa in 286 <br>
            Confucian and Taoist terms were used to render Buddhist terms. "offensive" words are eliminated <br>
            *** ko-i: matching concepts => choosing a group of Buddhist ideas and matchig them with a plausibly analogous grouping of indigenous ideas <br>
            apologetic writing: defense of the alien system. indicates the greatest conflicts between the two traditions <br>
            <br>

            <b>Early Buddhism and Taoism</b><br>
            Early Buddhism is generally regarded as a sect of religious Taoism. <br>
            <br>

            <i>I do not believe that there is anything in the world more propoer to dispose the spirit and the heart of the Chinese to embrace our holy religion than to make them see how it is in conformaty with their ancient and legitimate philosophy. </i>
            <br><br>

            <b>Typical Chinese Literati Who Turned to Buddhist</b><br>
            early training in Confucian classics <br>
            developed a strong interest in Lao-tzu and Chuang-tzu and achieved mastery in these texts <br>
            one day heard a famous monk lecture <br>
            became a monk, studied and began to preach <br>
            <br>
            
            <b>Mahayana and Hinayana: Subitism (tun) and Gradualism (chien)</b><br>
            Mahayana: after salvation the help of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas and the possibility of a single and sudden moment of enlightenment 
            => Subitism: apprehension of reality in a sudden and complete vision (associated with Taoism)<br>
            Hinayana: prescribe an age-long and arduous accumulation of positive karma leading to ultimate release into nirvana 
            = > Gradualism: approach to the ultimate reality by analysis, the accumulation of long study (associated with Confucianism)<br>
            <br>

            <b>Emperor Wu of the Liang</b><br>
            ordered to forsake Taoism and embrace Buddhism <br>
            <br>

            <b>Vimalakirti for the Rich and Powerful</b><br>
            Vimalakirti was not a naked ascetic but a rich and powerful aristocrat <br>
            new satisfaction for the rich and powerful in the lavish building of temples and retreats in the developing style of Chinese Buddhist architecture <br>
            <br>

            <b>North and South</b><br>
            in the South: Buddhism adjusted to elite and popular culture, interacted with southern philosophical and literary traditions, developed its beliefs and practices in response to the society <br>
            in the North: endless wars. Buddhism was introduced with its superior magical power. Buddhism did not have competition of an entrenched religious Taoism, and the peasantry were converted en masse. <br>
            Buddhist monks from the north migrated to the south and southern monks went north. <br>
            <br>
            
            <b>Kumarajiva</b><br>
            Mahayana Buddhism was presented in Chinese with far greater clarity and precision than ever before <br>
            Sunyata - Nagarjuna's concept of the void - was disentangled from the Taoist terminology <br>
            <br>
        </p>

        <h3>Sharf, 4-25</h3>

        <p><b>First (fragmentary) encounter: Eastern Han Dynasty via trade routes, Mahayana</b><br>
            Confucianism (disrepute), Buddhism (elite, practices similar to Taoism)<br>
            Obstacles: scarcity of authoritative Buddhist masters, lack of accurate translations of Indian texts <br>
            Kumarajiva <br>
            Evolution: Northern and Southern Dynasties <br>
            Golden Age: Sui and Tang (silk road, Hsuan-tsang and I-ching traveled to India, support of the court) <br>
            An Lu-shan rebellion: marks the beginning of the end of large-scale state patronage of Buddhism <br>
            Hui-chang persecution: Buddhism went into a long and inexorable decline <br>
            <br>

            <b>Four periods:</b> <br>
            preparation (Eastern Han and early Six Dynasties) <br>
            demestication (N & S Dynasties) <br>
            independent growth (Sui & Tang) <br>
            appropriation (Five Dynasties ++) <br>
            <br>

            <b>How "authentic" is Chinese Buddhism? => the Buddhist conquest of China || the Chinese transformation of Buddhism?</b><br>
            "missionaries" might have been religious refugees <br>
            little evidence that Indian or even central Asian Buddhist priests were active in large numbers <br>
            Kumarajiva's translation might be problematic <br>
            approch Buddhism through Taoism: replete with Taoist cosmology, terminology and meesianic eschatology <br>
            ... <br>
            But what is authentic? what is right? Who would have been in the position to judge?<br>
            There is no normative Buddhism. <br>
            <i>To claim privileged access to original or pure Buddhism, whether on the basis of the lineage, knowledge of scripture, meditative discipline, inner purity, or personal insight, 
                is to claim the authority and prestige of the tradition as one's own.
            </i> <br>
            <br>

            <b>Reconsider Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism and "syncretism"</b><br>
            The problem with syncretism: the category of syncretism presupposes the existence of distinct religious entities 
            that predate the syncretic amalgan precisely what is absent, or at least un recoverable. in the case of Buddhism. <br>
            <i>The authority of the word "Buddhism" lies not in its normative significations so much as in its rhetorical deployments. 
                This indeterminacy forced local Buddhist ecclesiastics to circumscribe orthodoxy and othorpraxis by juxtaposing Buddhism with the heterodox teachings of their imeediate rivals: 
                All self-conscious religious traditions define themselves through contradistinctions with the beliefs and practices of their neighbors.</i> <br>
            The unity of the three creeds (san-chiao ho-i) <br>
            misleading to conceive of the signification of Buddhism in terms of a dialogue between two discrete cultural traditions: <br>
            - dialogue is one sided <br>
            - Buddhism is construed in terms that compromise its descriptive value and analytic leverage <br>

            <br>
            The problem with cross-cultural transmission and translation: the Chinese preferred to translate foreign terms and concepts, creating sinitic neologisms when necessary <br>
            The nature of Chinese orthography: one cannot read the Chinese script aloud without actually knowing the language <br>
            <br>
        </p>

        <h3>Teiser 3-42</h3>

        <h3>Prompt</h3>
        <p>
            Sharf argues that there is no "normative" Buddhism, which is why he is skeptical about the frame that denies Chinese Buddhism. However, I agree with the view that the Chinese never truly understood Indian Buddhism. Instead, they developed their own interpretation based on Chinese cultural traditions. I think the reason why these religious traditions come together so well is largely due to the fact that the "Chinese" version of Buddhism shares lots of similarities with local religions such as Taoism. In fact, Chinese Buddhism is more like a local religion developed upon the skeleton of Indian Buddhism. For example, Buddhism and Taoism share extremely similar ideas on renunciation. As for conflicts, few can be found among the three creeds due to syncretism. This is not only because there were inaccurate translations, but also because in order to survive on this land, Indian Buddhism had to embrace sinification. For example, the Chinese Buddhists twisted their narratives on leaving their families to tailor to the Confucian view of filial piety. This syncretism is more obvious among the masses who are less educated to interpret the original Indian Buddhist scripts, which is why we need to look closer at popular practices. It suggests that the lay/pro divide in China exists largely due to the knowledge gap between the masses and the elites, as the masses do not have access to the more accurately translated written scripts as the elites do. <br>

        <h3>McRae's Rules of Zen Studies</h3>
        <p>
            - It's not true, and therefore it's more important. "Did it really happen?" <br>
            - Lineage assertions are as wrong as they are strong. "Lineage" under this context is more like teacher and students, but not family lineage. <br>
            - Precision implies inaccuracy. Numbers, dates and other details. The more "precise" they seem to be, the more inaccuracy there is. <br>
            - Romanticism breeds cynicism. Zen romanticists and the apologists for Confucian triumphalism. <br>
            <i>McRae's rules are essentially saying that, history itself is in fact not as important as the narratives.</i> <br>

        <h3>McRae, xix-xx, 1-45</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Chan Buddhism</b> <br>
            not posit words, seperate transmission outside the teachings ("不立文字，教外别传；直指人心，见性成佛") <br>
            Chan does not define itself as being one among a number of Buddhist schools based on a particular scripture such as Tiantai with its emphasis on the <i>Lotus Sutra</i> <br>
            the Chan lineage scheme is a combined product of Indian and Chinese culture <br>
            the "most Chinese" of all the Chinese Buddhist schools <br>
            <br>

            <b>Lineage-Based</b> <br>
            Chan practice is fundamentally genealogical (relational: involving interactions, generational: organized, reiterative: intended for repetition) <br> 
            there is no "thing" - such as enlightenment, the Buddha-mind, or whatever - that is actually passed from oen partriah to the next <br>
            the focus is not on "what" is being transmitted, but on the relationship of encounter between the Buddhas and patriahs <br>
            recognition of shared spiritual maturity <br>
            McRae's second rule: the more important it is to the religious identity of the individuals involved, the less accurate it will be <br>
            male-dominated, patriarchal: was Chan a weapon to oppress women within Chinese society <br>
            <br>

            <b>The "String of Pearls" Fallacy</b> <br>
            "string of pearls" fallacy: whenever we pretend to explain Chan in terms of lineal successions from one great master to another <br>
            <br>

            <b>Phases of Chinese Chan</b> <br>
            - Proto-Chan: <br> Bodhidharma, Huike  <br>
            <i>Treatise on the Two Entrances and Four Practices</i> <br>
            multiple locations in north China; practice based on Buddha-nature; no known lineage theory. Known through traditional texts and a few Dunhuang documents<br>
            - Early Chan: <br> Hongren; Shenxiu, Huineng; Shenhui; northern, southern, oxhead factions <br>
            <i>Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch</i><br>
            various loosely defined factions/groups, with different approaches to "comtemplation of the mind"; relationship between this and proto-Chan is unclear; lineage theory appear. Known through numerous Dunhuang documents and tradional sources <br>
            - Middle Chan: <br> Mazu, Shitou; Linji, Xuefeng Yicun; Hongzhou and Hubei factions, antecedents of the Five Houses <br>
            <i> Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall</i><br>
            emergence of the "encounter dialogue" as primary mode of practice and discourse, recorded in colloquial form and massive quantity in 952, and implying a genealogical model of religious cultivation. Not present in Dunhuang documents but known through Song texts <br>
            - Song-dynasty Chan: <br> Dahui, Hongzhi; Five Houses, Linji and Caodong schools<br>
            <i> Blue Cliff Record</i><br>
            greatest flourishing of Chan, which as an administrative ideology dominated the Chinese monastic establishment; the image of the Tang dynasty masters operating in enlightened spontaneity was inscribed in highly ritualized Song-dynasty settings; snippets of encounter dialogue were collected, edited to serve as precedents of enlightened activity, and used as topics of meditative inquiry <br>

        <h3>Prompt</h3>
        <p>
            I prefer Hui-neng’s interpretation of Buddhism. Shen-hsiu’s verse and Hui-neng’s verse remind me of the concepts of subitism (tun) and gradualism (chien) from the readings last week. In Shen-hsiu’s verse, he mentions that at all times we must strive to polish our mind, which somehow resonates with gradualism, suggesting that the acquisition of wisdom requires significant devotion and effort. As Wrights points out, gradualism reflects certain thinking of the Hinayana people (I know Hinayana is a troubling term but…let’s just use it for a second:), which is to gain nirvana after the accumulation of positive karma. Different from Shen-hsiu, Hui-neng’s verse sounds more like the Mahayana people, who advertise subitism in pursuit of Buddha nature. He says the mind is originally clean, and that we don’t need to worry about it being stained. This correlates with subitism, and suggests that a sudden moment of enlightenment is possible. Also, I feel like Hui-neng’s viewpoint of “not trying” actually shares some similarities with Taoist ideas that things are already in shape, and that we do not need to change or modify  them. Instead, we should just let them be. If we try too hard, we break the middle way and grow attachments and delusions, which push us away from instead of closer to wisdom and enlightenment.
