        <h1 id="key">KEY TERMS (pre-midterm)</h1>
        <p>
            The following are pre-midterm key terms from East Asian Buddhism. <br>
            Each of them follows a three dimensional definition of what it is, its historical context and how it relates to Buddhism. <br>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Vedas</b><br>
                    A group of text concerned about proper behavior. Transmitted orally. Written in Sanskrit. <br>
                    This is a pre-buddhism term from the Indo-Aryan culture. <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Aryans</b><br>
                    A group of people who invaded ancient India and shaped the Indian culture. <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Lay People</b><br>
                    Buddhists that are not monks, and live a household life. <br>
                    The connection between lay people and the buddha is established through worships and giving. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Brahmin</b><br>
                    According to the division of labors, Brahmins are religious professionals committed to transmitting the vedas.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Mantra</b><br>
                    Mantras associate words with power. Lots of them derived from scriptures.
                </li>
                <li class="new">
                    <b>Upanishads</b><br>
                    A set of stories about the beginning of India.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Samsara</b><br>
                    Samsara refers to the cycle of birth, life, death, and rebirth. <br>
                    This is a pre-buddhism term.
                </li>
                <li class="key">
                    <b>Karma</b><br>
                    The cosmic law to which the devas are subject to. Originally means ritual actions can cause effects.
                    Later means cause and effect. <br>
                    Three laws about Karma: <br>
                    The cause is always related to the effect and vice versa. <br>
                    The cause is always greater than the effect because it produces the effect. <br>
                    The effect always exists in cause until it comes to existence on its own. i.e. the effect is a latent potentiality. <br>
                    Karma is not particular to Buddhism. It is a pre-buddhism term. <br>
                    The buddhists think multiple causes lead to one effect, and that there are multiple or infinite effects caused by one cause. <br>
                    Also, karma is restricted to mental causes and effects under the buddhist context. <br>
                    <i>Karmic Stream</i> <br>
                    Because the body is impermanent, there are far more causes produced than effects experienced, which form a karmic stream.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Transmigration / Reincarnation / Rebirth</b><br>
                    Under Buddhist context: when there is no more effect to take, one reaches nirvana and stops reincarnation.
                </li>
                <li class="new">
                    <b>Eightfold Noble Path</b><br>
                    Right view, right resolve, right speech, right conduct, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right samadhi <br>
                    The fourth nobel truth states that the way to eliminate suffering is the eightfold noble path.
                </li>
                <li class="key">
                    <b>Asceticism / Renunciation</b><br>
                    Renunciation of pleasures and cultivation of pains in pursuit of clarity of thoughts and spiritual goals. <br>
                    The practice adopted by the sramanas before Buddhism.
                </li>
                <li class="key">
                    <b>Atman</b><br>
                    The eternal soul. The ultimate goal of the sramanas, who believe that you can achieve eternal soul if you practice asceticism.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Buddha</b><br>
                    The one whose death marks the birth of Buddhism. <br>
                    The stories of his previous reincarnations are noted in Jataka tales and he gained enlightenment in his final life as a prince. <br>
                </li>
                <li class="key">
                    <b>Bodhisattva</b><br>
                    Anyone who takes a vow to save others before reaching nirvana is on the path of Bodhisattva. <br>
                    This is a term specific to Mahayana Buddhism. <br>
                    <i>However, note that there is still clear lay-pro distinction even if everyone can be Bodhisattva.</i>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Meditation</b><br>
                    Meditation is a process that is believed to bring clearity of thoughts. <br>
                    It is adopted by both the sramanas and the buddhists. And the Buddha also took this practice when he was in the forest.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Siddhartha</b><br>
                    The name of the Buddha.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Jataka Tales</b><br>
                    Tales of the previous reincarnations of the Buddha. <br>
                    In these stories, he is a lay man instead of a professional with superhuman compassion, which indicates that good deeds can be done by anyone, and that what you do right now as a lay person is important.
                    In order to obtain the ultimate wisdom, you must have compassion. <br>
                    => Compassion and lay practices fit together naturally. You need many lifetimes of compassion to become a Buddha. <br>
                    All sentient beings are on the same path, but not at the same pace.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Sramana</b><br>
                    A group of people who practice asceticism in pursuit of the atman. "Your soul is eternal, but your body vanishes." <br>
                    They introduced the term reincarnation. <br>
                    They see karma as the chain that binds us to this world. "By taking effects, you are chained." <br>
                    They also see karma as the spiritual dust that need to get rid of. <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Cakravartin Prophecy</b><br>
                    A prophecy made upon the birth of the Buddha, that he will either conquer the material world or the spiritual world. <br>
                    Demonstrates the duality between material and spiritual world.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Four Visions / Sights / Encounters</b><br>
                    Old age, sickness, death and the sramana. <br>
                    Before becoming the Buddha, the prince saw a man of old age, a sick man, a corpse and a sramana, from whom he first realized that suffering existed. <br>
                    These people are disguised by the devas, who needed the Buddha to attain enlightenment so that he could guide them in the spiritual world if they fall. <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Four Noble Truths</b><br>
                    All is suffering. <br>
                    There are causes to the suffering. <br>
                    There is a way to eliminate the causes of suffering. <br>
                    The way to eliminate suffering is the Eightfold Noble Path. <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Suffering</b> (Sanskrit: duhkha, Pali: dukkha)<br>
                    suffering = attachments + delusions <br>
                    Either will make you suffer, and they feed each other. <br>
                    The greatest delusion of all is the delusion of self, of the existence of Atman. <br>
                    Suffering is different from pain. The former is mental while the latter is physical. You feel the pain, but you don't suffer. 
                </li>
                <li class="key">
                    <b>Middle Way</b><br>
                    The middle way means a balance between extreme asceticism and too much indulgence into the material world. <br>
                    During his life in forest, the Buddha decides that extreme asceticism is simply counter human dignity, and that you will become attach to it. <br>
                    Too much asceticism is not the answer to enlightenment and wisdom. Instead, the answer is the middle way.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Sujata</b><br>
                    An Indian girl who offered rice water to the buddha when he was practicing asceticism in the forest.
                    After drinking the rice water, the buddha attained enlightenment. <br>
                    This story marks the lay-pro distinction: lay people give (compassion oriented), and pros meditate (wisdom oriented). It also suggests what you do as a lay person matters.
                </li>
                <li class="key">
                    <b>Nirvana</b><br>
                    Nirvana means extinction and cessation. It is a state that you reach once you work off the karma

                    <b>Death of the Buddha (Parinirvana)</b><br>
                    The buddha died after eating a piece of meat offered by a blacksmith. He felt the pain but did not suffer. 
                    He didn't fight his death because he acknowledged all is impermanent, and he had no attachment to himself.
                </li>

                    It is one of the three treasures of Buddhism. <br>
                    After the birth of Mahayana, there was the exploding canon where all sorts of Mahayana sciptures were discovered. <br>
                    Unlike Arhat Buddhists, the Mahayana people use these scriptures to gain more karma through chanting. This is referred to as the karmic engines.
                </li>

                    After the birth of Mahayana, the lay-pro divide was blurred since everyone could be a Bodhisattva.

                    Mahayana: the three bodies of the Buddha (historical, bliss body, greate non-dual substance), Dharma (exploding canon, karmic engine), Sangha (blurring lay-pro divide, Bodhisattva)

                    <b>Skillful Means</b><br>
                    Everyone is at a different stage. You need to tailor the teaching to reach them where they are. <br>
                    The Buddha realized this during the first sermon after he gained enlightenment.

                    To teach Buddhism one has to use language, but language is only the provisional truth. <br>
                    The absolute truth is non-duality and emptiness.

                    The idea of the vow is to save everyone else in this world before you gain nirvana. <br>
                    It is a product of the Mahayana Buddhism, and demonstrates the power of language. <br>

                    A term used in Chinese cosmology. <br>
                    Qi is uncreated, inherently unstable, resonant. It cannot be made or destroyed. It can be less or more refined. <br>
                    Also, it can be viewed as Yin or Yang.

                    They read from the cracks on the bones, after which they would carve into the bones the questions they ask and the answers they get. <br>
                    This is only done for the ruler and his family.

                    You can't have only Yin or Yang. They are not opposites but complement each other.

                    These five phases form a patterning of five with which the Chinese make omens and divinations. <br>

                    A story about a monk Mu-lien is thus invented, in which the Buddha sets up a ghost festival so that the dead can reunite with their family for three days each year when the Sangha chant to open the gate of hell.
                    This shows how the Buddhists interposed themselves into the Chinese filial piety culture and evolved into a ritually oriented religion.

        <h1 id="key2">KEY TERMS (post-midterm)</h1>
        <p>
            The following are post-midterm key terms from East Asian Buddhism. <br>
            Each of them follows a three dimensional definition of what it is, its historical context and how it relates to Buddhism. <br>

                    <b>Millennialism</b><br>
                    Millennialism means the end of the world and the end of Dharma. <br>
                    At the end of the Han dynasty, due to constant wars and killings, the Chinese people believed that was the end of the world. <br>
                    So the buddhists introduced the Dharma king to cope with this situation of millennialism.

                    Chinese religious system is a locative system, yet Buddhism is not. <br>
                    To fit into this locative tradition, Buddhism embraced new narratives about buddhist icons located at specific spots.

        <p>
            <b>Hinduism</b><br>
            five religions in India: Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Jainism, Sikhism. <br>
            Hinduism: <br>
            - the oldest and the youngest religion: started at 1200 B.C.E, didn't have a name until 19th century <br>
            - 83 percent of India's population is Hindu. <br>
            - no founding figure, no single text that can serve as a doctrine, no single overarching institution <br>
            - centralist and pluralist view: pan-Indian, brahmanic class vs ideas and practices. <br>
            <br>

            <b>Indo-Aryans and Vedas</b><br>
            Aryas: "the noble ones", came from Russia, conquered India. <br>
            Veda: "knowledge, religious knowledge" <br>
            Four vedic collections: the Rg Veda, Yajur Veda, Sama Veda, and the Atharva Veda <br>
            supplementary compositions are too part of Veda: Brahmanas, Aranyakas, Upanisads <br>
            the Rg Veda: earliest: praise of Indra (warrior - fight), Agni (priest - sacrifice) <br>
            Vedic hymns are understood as a powerful and efficacious speech - mantra <br>
            <br>

            <b>Sacrifice and Society</b><br>

        <h3>Gombrich, 1-5, 87-124</h3>
        <p>
            <b>General Principles of the Vinaya</b><br>
            brahminism (social) - buddhism (middle) - jainism (individual) <br>
            vinaya: <br>
            - sutta-vibbanga: commentary on personal conduct <br>
            - khandhaka: rules of community life <br>
            <br>

            <b>The Middle Way</b> <br>
            neither comfort nor discomfort should become an issue to distract one from the quest for enlightenment. 
            what the Buddha stressed was the monk's subjective state of satisfaction. he always wanted to separate the Sangha from extremists <br>
            If a comfort does not become an obstacle to the life of renunciation, monastic Buddhism does not consider it unsuitable for renouncers. <br>
            properties beyond the standard lists of possessions had to belong to the Sangha as a corporate body not to any individual <br>
            <br>
            what's important is to be "content with little", and that can be cultivated without stereotyped asceticism <br>
            renouncers are supposed to be outside the social system, but outside can shade into above. <br>
            respect for freedom from material want is a universal Indian value. <br>
            monks are not allowed to refuse proper gifts given to the whole Sangha. to refuse them would deprive the lay donor of a chance to earn merit <br>
            <br>
            the idea of homelessness permeates early Buddhism. <br>
            the middle way again: brahminism (householder's fixity) - Buddhism - Jainism (perpetual motion) <br>
            <br>
            the middle way in washing, in food, etc.

        <p><b>The Period of Preparation</b><br>
            preconditions of the spread of the influence of Buddhism in China: <br>
            make the Chinese of all classes responsive to new ideas and institutions, particularly those of alien origin <br>
            make Buddhism go through the preliminary process of adaptation <br>
            <br>

            <b>Humanizing of Confucianism</b><br>
            struggle among the four groups (the entrenched great families, the eunuchs, the nouveaux riches and the intelligntsia) => conflicting power interests => naturalistic critique of Han Confucianism <br>
            reluctant to renounce all the principles of order, hierarchy and stability which that synthesis had provided <br>
            turned to the long-neglected classics of Taoism => no positive means of restoring a viable society (pure escapism, cynical peace with the corrupt tyrants...)<br>
            <i>Yet it was the cataclysm of mass revolt and political collapse which inspired further and more searching attacks on the old orthodoxy, bringing it at last into something like total disrepute</i><br>
            The breakdown of the ecumenical order of the Han permitted the spread of Buddhism throughout the Chinese world <br>
            <br>

        <h3>Prompt</h3>
        <p>
            Sharf argues that there is no "normative" Buddhism, which is why he is skeptical about the frame that denies Chinese Buddhism. However, I agree with the view that the Chinese never truly understood Indian Buddhism. Instead, they developed their own interpretation based on Chinese cultural traditions. I think the reason why these religious traditions come together so well is largely due to the fact that the "Chinese" version of Buddhism shares lots of similarities with local religions such as Taoism. In fact, Chinese Buddhism is more like a local religion developed upon the skeleton of Indian Buddhism. For example, Buddhism and Taoism share extremely similar ideas on renunciation. As for conflicts, few can be found among the three creeds due to syncretism. This is not only because there were inaccurate translations, but also because in order to survive on this land, Indian Buddhism had to embrace sinification. For example, the Chinese Buddhists twisted their narratives on leaving their families to tailor to the Confucian view of filial piety. This syncretism is more obvious among the masses who are less educated to interpret the original Indian Buddhist scripts, which is why we need to look closer at popular practices. It suggests that the lay/pro divide in China exists largely due to the knowledge gap between the masses and the elites, as the masses do not have access to the more accurately translated written scripts as the elites do. <br>

        <h3>McRae's Rules of Zen Studies</h3>
        <p>
            - It's not true, and therefore it's more important. "Did it really happen?" <br>
            - Lineage assertions are as wrong as they are strong. "Lineage" under this context is more like teacher and students, but not family lineage. <br>
            - Precision implies inaccuracy. Numbers, dates and other details. The more "precise" they seem to be, the more inaccuracy there is. <br>
            - Romanticism breeds cynicism. Zen romanticists and the apologists for Confucian triumphalism. <br>
            <i>McRae's rules are essentially saying that, history itself is in fact not as important as the narratives.</i> <br>

        <h3>McRae, xix-xx, 1-45</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Chan Buddhism</b> <br>
            not posit words, seperate transmission outside the teachings ("不立文字，教外别传；直指人心，见性成佛") <br>
            Chan does not define itself as being one among a number of Buddhist schools based on a particular scripture such as Tiantai with its emphasis on the <i>Lotus Sutra</i> <br>
            the Chan lineage scheme is a combined product of Indian and Chinese culture <br>
            the "most Chinese" of all the Chinese Buddhist schools <br>
            <br>

            <b>Lineage-Based</b> <br>
            Chan practice is fundamentally genealogical (relational: involving interactions, generational: organized, reiterative: intended for repetition) <br> 
            there is no "thing" - such as enlightenment, the Buddha-mind, or whatever - that is actually passed from oen partriah to the next <br>
            the focus is not on "what" is being transmitted, but on the relationship of encounter between the Buddhas and patriahs <br>
            recognition of shared spiritual maturity <br>
            McRae's second rule: the more important it is to the religious identity of the individuals involved, the less accurate it will be <br>
            male-dominated, patriarchal: was Chan a weapon to oppress women within Chinese society <br>
            <br>

            <b>The "String of Pearls" Fallacy</b> <br>
            "string of pearls" fallacy: whenever we pretend to explain Chan in terms of lineal successions from one great master to another <br>

        <h3>Prompt</h3>
        <p>
            I prefer Hui-neng’s interpretation of Buddhism. Shen-hsiu’s verse and Hui-neng’s verse remind me of the concepts of subitism (tun) and gradualism (chien) from the readings last week. In Shen-hsiu’s verse, he mentions that at all times we must strive to polish our mind, which somehow resonates with gradualism, suggesting that the acquisition of wisdom requires significant devotion and effort. As Wrights points out, gradualism reflects certain thinking of the Hinayana people (I know Hinayana is a troubling term but…let’s just use it for a second:), which is to gain nirvana after the accumulation of positive karma. Different from Shen-hsiu, Hui-neng’s verse sounds more like the Mahayana people, who advertise subitism in pursuit of Buddha nature. He says the mind is originally clean, and that we don’t need to worry about it being stained. This correlates with subitism, and suggests that a sudden moment of enlightenment is possible. Also, I feel like Hui-neng’s viewpoint of “not trying” actually shares some similarities with Taoist ideas that things are already in shape, and that we do not need to change or modify  them. Instead, we should just let them be. If we try too hard, we break the middle way and grow attachments and delusions, which push us away from instead of closer to wisdom and enlightenment.

        <h3>Another Prompt on Koan</h3>
        <p>
            The Koan that I respond to is <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Gateless_Gate/Nansen_Cuts_the_Cat_in_Two">this one</a>. <br>
            How I’d interpret this Koan: <br>
            The cat was cut in two because Nansen acknowledged duality, that a cat could be divided into two parts, and that there existed divergence between the eastern hall and the western hall. <br>
            Joshu, on the other hand, denied duality by placing his sandals, which were supposed to be worn on the feet, onto his head. What he did was essentially saying that in a dualist view, the head and feet are the two ends of a body, yet from a non-dualist perspective, there are no ends. The human head and feet are essentially part of the whole body. <br>
            I have multiple interpretations for what this Koan was trying to convey with the fact that no one said a good word to save the cat. I think this is indicating that language is extremely limited, and that no word is able to reveal the true nature of good. Another interpretation I have is that, there is no good or bad, which again correlates with the non-dualist point of view. <br>
            <br>

            What I would do if I hear the story as a student: <br>
            Well first of all perform, without using language. <br>
            Then show Nansen non-duality. It depends on what I have in my hands at that moment. Anything could be used, sandals, whatever. But I guess the easiest way is just to slap him, showing him the sound of one hand 😬😬 <br>

            <b>Japanese Religion</b><br>
            not a specific religion, but rather a general abstration. <br>
            five religious strands: Shinto, Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, and folk religion, with Christianity possibly the sixth.<br>
            <ul>
                <li>shinto: <br> 
                    emerged from the beliefs and practices of prehistoric Japan, but in close contact with the religious influences of China and Korea. <br>
                    central to shinto is the notion of Japan as the land of kami. shinto means "the way of the kami"
                </li>
                <li>Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism: <br>
                    importations from China and Korea. <br>
                    Buddhism was received as part of Chinese civilization. <br>
                    Taoism never existed in Japan as a formal religion, elements of Taoism were accepted and heavily influenced Buddhism and Shinto as well as popular religion.  <br>
                    Confucianism: government support. Confucianism provided notions of social and political identity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    folk religion: <br>
                    refers to beliefs and practices that have been handled down and have existed outside organized traditions. <br>
                    may date back to prehistoric times.
                </li>
            </ul>
            individual strands did not exist in isolation. <br>
            "mutual influence" <br>
            any strand is not just the strand itself but a combination of several influences. <br>

            Six themes:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <i>the closeness of human beings, gods, and nature <br></i>
                    emphasize neither one sovereign God nor a sharp distinction between the many gods and human beings. <br>
                    three realms are on equal terms: the aim is to form a triangle of harmoniious interrelationships. <br>
                    gods can be understood as either the kami of Shinto or the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of Buddhism. <br>
                    kami: the primary consideration is power instead of goodness. evil things can also be kami. Humans can be kami. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>the religious character of the family <br></i>
                    ancestor worship <br>
                    Japanese family oftentimes is an extended family of three or more generations. head of family serves as a priest whereas home is the center of religious devotion. <br>
                    family is important not only for revering ancestors but also for providing cohesion for religious activities
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>the significance of purification, rituals, and amulets <br></i>
                    borrowings from Indian and Chinese traditions <br>
                    purification: physical + spiritual <br>
                    rituals: performance of which is more important than the acceptance of comprehensive creedal statements. <br>
                    amulets: formally sanctioned and widespread.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>the prominence of local festivals and individual cults <br></i>
                    local festivals: come into contact with the sacred power of kami and Buddhas
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>the pervasiveness of religion in everyday life <br></i>
                    religion is related to economic activities: fishing, rice cultivation, etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>the intimate bond between religion and the nation <br></i>
                    Buddhism helped unify and support the government, and the state patronized Buddhism. so did Taoism and Confucianism. <br>
                    they were also used to support nationalism and militarism between 1868 and 1945. <br>
                    however, the relationship between the state and religion is under debate. some people see it as a distortion of the Japanese tradition

            Shinto rituals involves elaborate offerings of food - rice, vegetables, salt, fruit and fish. <br>
            three distinctive characteristics of Shinto: <br>
            - political: emphasis on the identity of the Japanese nation with the imperial family and the descent of this family from the ancestral kami <br>
            - philosophical: realistic affirmation of life and values in this world <br>
            - ethical: reverence of the bright and pure in all matter <br>
            the three form the "intellectual strain"<br>
            Shinto is distinctive, but not unique. <br>

        <h3>Prompt</h3>
        <p>In order to understand Buddhism in Japan, one has to take into consideration all other four religions, in particular Shinto, since any strand is not just the strand itself but a combination of several influences. There is no single sacred scripture in Japan that is considered authoritative for all people, and individuals consciously affiliated themselves with several traditions. Therefore, two different religions may share certain terms. For example, “gods” in Japan can be understood as either kami in Shinto, or the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas in Buddhism. Also, different religions share some common rituals. For example, the Japanese hold local festivals to connect with both the kami and the Buddhas and the Bodhisattvas, and receive their sacred power. This happens as a result of integrating local traditions from Shinto with imported traditions such as Buddhism. However, we should also note how Japanese Buddhism is distinct from Indian Buddhism and Chinese Buddhism for the very same reason of integration, despite the fact that Japanese Buddhism was originally imported from China and, fundamentally, from India. In conclusion, just like what Earhart suggests for Shinto, we should realize the distinctive characteristics of Japanese Buddhism without claiming that there are unique properties of Japanese Buddhism entirely absent from the other four strands.</p><br>
