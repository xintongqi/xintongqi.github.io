        <h2>Las Meninas</h2>
        <h5>Diego Velázquez, 1656, Spain, Oil on canvas</h5>
        <p>
            Notice the painter on the left hand side who is shaded by the canvas. 
            The painter is looking out at us, the viewers of this painting, as well as the spectators inside the painting. <br>
            <i>"reciprocal visibility"</i> between the painter and the viewers, us<br>
            <i>"the image should stand out from the frame"</i> by Pachero <br>
            <br>
            The dual purposes of the canvas on the left: <br>
            1) adds movement to this still painting: the painter could be visible/invisible depending on if he's painting or not <br>
            2) prevents the gazes from the audience (us) being definitely established <br>
            <br>
            A virtual triangle that defines a picture of this picture: <br>
            at the top: the painter's eyes <br>
            one base angle: the invisible place occupied by the model <br>
            another base angle: the figure sketched out on the canvas <br>
            <br>
            The light from the right envelops the figures and directs towards the place where the painter's brush points to. <br>
            <br>
            All canvas hanging on the wall are blurred except for one: that one in the center is not a painting, but a mirror.
            In Dutch paintings it was traditional for mirrors to play a duplicating role, but here the mirror is saying something not covered in the painting itself, that the King and his wife are here to watch.
            Also the positioning of the mirror is subtle: its upper edge runs halfway between the top and the bottom of the canvas. <br>
            <b>The punchline of this painting is the mirror, with its three functions:</b><br>
            1) it is the reverse of the hidden canvas on the left. hidden vs revealing <br>
            2) it leaps out of the painting itself by showing you who's watching<br>
            3) it stands adjacent to the doorway, where a man is gazing outside of the scene as well <br>
            <br>
            <b>What this painting is about:</b><br>
            Velázquez himself is painting in his studio, a bunch of people are watching him paint, and some people are watching those who are watching :) <br>
