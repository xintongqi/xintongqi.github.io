        <h2>Las Meninas</h2>
        <h5>Diego Vel치zquez, 1656, Spain, Oil on canvas</h5>
        <p>
            Notice the painter on the left hand side who is shaded by the canvas. 
            The painter is looking out at us, the viewers of this painting, as well as the spectators inside the painting. <br>
            <i>"reciprocal visibility"</i> between the painter and the viewers, us<br>
            <i>"the image should stand out from the frame"</i> by Pachero <br>
            <br>
            The dual purposes of the canvas on the left: <br>
            1) adds movement to this still painting: the painter could be visible/invisible depending on if he's painting or not <br>
            2) prevents the gazes from the audience (us) being definitely established <br>
            <br>
            A virtual triangle that defines a picture of this picture: <br>
            at the top: the painter's eyes <br>
            one base angle: the invisible place occupied by the model <br>
            another base angle: the figure sketched out on the canvas <br>
            <br>
            The light from the right envelops the figures and directs towards the place where the painter's brush points to. <br>
            <br>
            All canvas hanging on the wall are blurred except for one: that one in the center is not a painting, but a mirror.
            In Dutch paintings it was traditional for mirrors to play a duplicating role, but here the mirror is saying something not covered in the painting itself, that the King and his wife are here to watch.
            Also the positioning of the mirror is subtle: its upper edge runs halfway between the top and the bottom of the canvas. <br>
            <b>The punchline of this painting is the mirror, with its three functions:</b><br>
            1) it is the reverse of the hidden canvas on the left. hidden vs revealing <br>
            2) it leaps out of the painting itself by showing you who's watching<br>
            3) it stands adjacent to the doorway, where a man is gazing outside of the scene as well <br>
            <br>
            About Infanta Margarita: the princess in the middle, the center image <br>
            A vertical line dividing the canvas into two halves passes right through her eyes, and her face is a third of the total height. 
            By rules of composition, the princess is the center of the painting, and to stress that, Vel치zquez adds a person kneeling below, looking towards the central one, and a person to the right looking at her as well. <br>

            <br>
            <b>What this painting is about:</b><br>
            Vel치zquez himself is painting for the couple in his studio, a bunch of people are watching him paint, and some people are watching those who are watching :) <br>
            <br>

        <h2>Rhetoric of the Image</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Analysis of the Panzani advertisement</b> <br>
            1. linguistic messages from the text: <br>
            1) denotational: the company name itself <br>
            2) connotational: implication of the "italianicity" of the company <br>
            2. pure image: <br>
            1) a half-open bag which lets the provisions spill out over the table, "unpacked" -> freshness <br>
            2) tomatoes, pepper and the tricolored hues -> italianicity <br>
            3) the composition that symbolizes "nature morte" ("still life") -> aesthetics <br>
            3. objects in the scene: <br>
            we see the pasta, tomatoes and stuff, and with our perceptions we know it's an ad for pasta <br>
            <br>

            <b>How do we analyze an image in general?</b> <br>
            1. the linguistic message <br>
            titles, captions, accompanying press articles, film dialogues, comic strip balloons, etc. <br>
            two functions of the linguistic messages: <br>
            - anchorage (more common): directs the reader through the signifieds of the image, helps the spectator to choose the correct level of perception -> to be sure what it is talking about <br>
            - relay (less common): stands in a complementary relationship with the image <br>
            2. the denoted image <br>
