        <h2>Las Meninas</h2>
        <h5>Diego Velázquez, 1656, Spain, Oil on canvas</h5>
        <p>
            Notice the painter on the left hand side who is shaded by the canvas. 
            The painter is looking out at us, the viewers of this painting, as well as the spectators inside the painting. <br>
            <i>"reciprocal visibility"</i> between the painter and the viewers, us<br>
            <i>"the image should stand out from the frame"</i> by Pachero <br>
            <br>
            The dual purposes of the canvas on the left: <br>
            1) adds movement to this still painting: the painter could be visible/invisible depending on if he's painting or not <br>
            2) prevents the gazes from the audience (us) being definitely established <br>
            <br>
            A virtual triangle that defines a picture of this picture: <br>
            at the top: the painter's eyes <br>
            one base angle: the invisible place occupied by the model <br>
            another base angle: the figure sketched out on the canvas <br>
            <br>
            The light from the right envelops the figures and directs towards the place where the painter's brush points to. <br>
            <br>
            All canvas hanging on the wall are blurred except for one: that one in the center is not a painting, but a mirror.
            In Dutch paintings it was traditional for mirrors to play a duplicating role, but here the mirror is saying something not covered in the painting itself, that the King and his wife are here to watch.
            Also the positioning of the mirror is subtle: its upper edge runs halfway between the top and the bottom of the canvas. <br>
            <b>The punchline of this painting is the mirror, with its three functions:</b><br>
            1) it is the reverse of the hidden canvas on the left. hidden vs revealing <br>
            2) it leaps out of the painting itself by showing you who's watching<br>
            3) it stands adjacent to the doorway, where a man is gazing outside of the scene as well <br>
            <br>
            About Infanta Margarita: the princess in the middle, the center image <br>
            A vertical line dividing the canvas into two halves passes right through her eyes, and her face is a third of the total height. 
            By rules of composition, the princess is the center of the painting, and to stress that, Velázquez adds a person kneeling below, looking towards the central one, and a person to the right looking at her as well. <br>

            <br>
            <b>What this painting is about:</b><br>
            Velázquez himself is painting for the couple in his studio, a bunch of people are watching him paint, and some people are watching those who are watching :) <br>
            <br>

        <h2>Rhetoric of the Image</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Analysis of the Panzani advertisement</b> <br>
            1. linguistic messages from the text: <br>
            1) denotational: the company name itself <br>
            2) connotational: implication of the "italianicity" of the company <br>
            2. pure image: <br>
            1) a half-open bag which lets the provisions spill out over the table, "unpacked" -> freshness <br>
            2) tomatoes, pepper and the tricolored hues -> italianicity <br>
            3) the composition that symbolizes "nature morte" ("still life") -> aesthetics <br>
            3. objects in the scene: <br>
            we see the pasta, tomatoes and stuff, and with our perceptions we know it's an ad for pasta <br>
            <br>

            <b>How do we analyze an image in general?</b> <br>
            1. the linguistic message <br>
            titles, captions, accompanying press articles, film dialogues, comic strip balloons, etc. <br>
            two functions of the linguistic messages: <br>
            - anchorage (more common): directs the reader through the signifieds of the image, helps the spectator to choose the correct level of perception -> to be sure what it is talking about <br>
            - relay (less common): stands in a complementary relationship with the image <br>
            2. the denoted image <br>

        <h2>Pericles</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Funeral Oration of Pericles</b><br>
            Thucydides: a Greek writer of the period during which the Parthenon was constructed. He wrote books on the Peloponnesian War, in which the funeral oration given be Pericles was recorded. <br>
            Pericles: one of the most prominent leaders of the Athenian democracy. <br>
            The Peloponnesian War: a war between Athens and Sparta (431-404 BCE), which were two of the most powerful autonomous city-states in Greek at that time. Athens was eventually defeated. 
            Pericles was active at the beginning of the war, but he died of a plague that overruled Athens soon after. The plague was considered a significant cause of its final defeat. <br>
            Parthenon was built one year prior to the breakout of the war. It symbolizes Athenian civic principles and pride. It is a political monument as well as a religious center. <br>
            <br>
            Read the full oration <a href="http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/education/thucydides.html#:~:text=To%20those%20of%20you%20who,of%20those%20who%20are%20gone.">here</a>. It's very beautiful, well-written and touching, in my humble opinion. I nearly cried over this... <br>
            <br>
            <b>Life of Pericles</b><br>
            Born a noble, with almost perfect physical features except that he had a super long head, which is why his portraits are all showing him wearing a helmet. <br>
            He learns music, philosophy, and so on. He was particularly close to Anaxagoris of Clazonmenae, great man and admired by Pericles. <br>
            As a young man Pericles was inclined to shrink from facing the people. 
            But finally he decided to attach himself to the people's party and to take up the cause of the poor and the many instead of that of the rich and the few, which was opposed to his own temperament. <br>
            Still, he reserved himself, and only spoke for great occasions. Whenever he spoke, it was thunder and lightening. He was really good at persuasion. <br>
            His administration was "democracy in name, but in practice government by the first citizen". He was the first who led on the people into passing allotment, granting of allowances, fees for public services, etc. <br>
            The aristocratic party put forward Thucydides to prevent Pericles from being too powerful. 
            As a response, Pericles chose to hand over the reins of power to the people to a greater extent and deliberately shaped his policy to please them. 
            But his attitudes changed over time as well. In general, he ruled the Athenians by using their hopes and fears as if they were rudders. Pericles made Athens the greatest and richest of all cities. <br>
            Resentment against Pericles piled up when the plague outbursted. He also died of this plague. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Pericles and His Construction of Public Buildings</b><br>
            Mixed opinions: <br>
            - Supporters and himself: 1) Athenians were not obliged to give the allies any account of how their money was spent, provided that they carried on the war for them and kept the Persians away. 
            2) Some people can benefit from his campaigns by joining the armies, but those who can't should also have some ways of earning, thus constructions. <br>
            - Opposers: People's contributions were used to beautify the city instead of in wars against the Persians. So Pericles said he would pay for these constructions. <br>
            <br>
            These buildings were completed very fast. The director and supervisor of the whole enterprise was mostly Pheidias, Pericles's entrusted friend, but Parthenon was completed by Callicrates and Ictinus. <br>
            More on Pheidias: he built the statue of Athene that stands erect in the Parthenon of Athens. <br> 
            <br> 
            Really like these words. Well said. <br>
            <i>Pericles deserves our admiration, then, not only for the sense of justice and the serene
                temper that he preserved amid the many crises and intense personal hatreds which surrounded him, but
                also for his greatness of spirit. He considered it the highest of all his claims to honour that, despite the
                immense power he wielded, he had never given way to feelings of envy or hatred and had treated no
                man as so irreconcilable an enemy that he could never become his friend. </i><br>
